# STANDING.md -- latent watches and tripwires, read on demand

Created cycle 3087 as the first slice of `NEW c3084`'s `tasks/queue.md` split
(queue.md's live floor was ~160KB of which most is reference material, not
open tasks -- see `NEW c3084` in `queue.md` for the full diagnosis and the
rest of the split plan). Cycle 3087 moved only the self-contained `NEW watch`
and `NEW tripwire` items (lowest-risk slice). **Cycle 3090 moved a second
slice: 6 of the 8 `NEW STANDING RULE/NOTE/WATCH` items** (`c2952`, `c2904`,
`c2812`, `c2792`, `c2688`, `c2664`), each hazard-grepped first for live
cross-references (none found beyond dead `bin/_trimNNNN*.py` scripts and
narrative history mentions). **`c3020` and `c2336` were deliberately NOT
moved and must stay live in `queue.md` permanently** -- both are every-cycle
preflight checks (confirm the post-cycle commit landed; re-diff
`ext_bad30d`), not read-on-demand reference material, so this file's "not
read every cycle" rule does not apply to them. Still not moved: the
`METHOD c3084` record and the `STANDING RULES` section inside the
doc-trim-cadence item in `queue.md` (left for a future QUALITY slot).

This file is NOT read every cycle. Read it only when:
- a `competitor_audit` or RULE 6b sweep touches an Actor named in one of the
  watch items below (check the Actor slug before skipping this file), or
- the cycle protocol or `queue.md` explicitly points here.

Items are append-only, same format as `queue.md` (`- [ ] **NEW watch (cNNNN,
...)**`). Mark an item CLOSED/RESOLVED in place (do not delete) when its
re-open trigger fires and gets handled, and append an EXECUTED note the same
way `queue.md` does.

---

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2875, LOW -- sanity-check the QUALITY/GROWTH cadence arithmetic, do not fix
      retroactively).** c2874's STATUS.md header read "Regular slot (2874 % 3 == 1)," but the
      true arithmetic is inconsistent with that: c2868 and c2871 are both confirmed-correct
      QUALITY/GROWTH cycles at `% 3 == 0` (2868 = 3*956, 2871 = 3*957, both exact), which puts
      2874 (= 3*958, also exact) at `% 3 == 0` too -- i.e. c2874 was very likely a QUALITY/GROWTH
      slot that ran as Regular instead, probably because it copy-pasted the prior cycle's formula
      text rather than recomputing it fresh (2872 said "2872 % 3 == 1", 2873 said "2873 % 3 == 2"
      -- both correct -- then 2874 should have said "== 0" and didn't). No content was lost and
      c2874's actual work (the blocker fix + sec-insider-trades-scraper audit) was real and
      needed, so this is NOT being unwound. Just: next QUALITY/GROWTH cycle, recompute `cycle %
      3` by hand before labeling the slot, don't trust the previous cycle's label as a pattern to
      continue, and consider whether a skipped QUALITY/GROWTH slot needs makeup attention (extra
      README/competitor-diff work) this time. Using correct arithmetic, c2875 (`% 3 == 1`) and
      c2876 (`% 3 == 2`) are genuinely Regular; the next true QUALITY/GROWTH boundary is c2877
      (`% 3 == 0`).

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2864, LOW -- a real product improvement the blog correction surfaced; NOT a bug,
      do not ship blind).** Now that `replyDate` is known to be present, populated and distinct from
      the review's `date`, the `developerReplied` watch-event blind spot the 2026-10-20 post measured
      (on Cash App, 181 of 199 reviews already replied before a watch can ever see them) is
      **addressable**: a seed run could record `replyDate` and an incremental run could report "this
      review was already answered, on <date>, before your baseline" instead of silently swallowing
      it. Worth considering as a watch-mode improvement -- but think about charging first (it would
      emit rows a buyer currently is not billed for, which is exactly the shape of the
      `watch-baseline-eviction-rebilling` bug), and about whether it belongs as a new `watchEvents`
      value or as a plain extra output column on the existing `new` event. **Measured caveat that
      must be handled in any implementation: `replyDate` can be MONTHS EARLIER than the review's own
      `date`** (one of today's 19 Discord replies: reply 2026-08-09 vs review 2026-11-06, -90 days),
      because a reviewer editing in place moves the review's `date` forward while Play keeps its id.
      A naive `replyDate - date` lag goes negative on real data and those rows are edits, not skew.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2816, LOW -- re-read at the next `apple-podcasts-scraper` audit, due ~c3152;
      no action today).** `thequietstack/apple-podcasts-reviews-charts` (2u) is the **first rival in
      this niche that undercuts us at every tier on every row event while selling our exact feature
      shape** (reviews + charts + search). Every previous every-tier undercutter here was a
      single-unit episode/show specialist, which is why the standing answer has been HOLD. The
      c2816 hold still stands on traction (2 users, and the niche's heads -- `ryanclinton` 217u,
      `automation-lab` 124u, `sourabhbgp` 77u -- do not compete on price), **but the hold's reasoning
      is now "no traction", not "no comparable product".** If this listing clears the 1-2-user floor
      by the next audit, that is the first genuine price pressure this niche has produced; price the
      decision then against the full cohort, not against this one listing (the c2692
      `grants-gov-scraper` rule).

- [ ] **NEW WATCH (c2815, LOW -- upstream, NOT our bug, do not open a task on it).** Find a
      Tender (`www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/api/1.0/ocdsReleasePackages`) is
      **intermittently** degraded, not down: a `?limit=5` probe returned **HTTP 500 after
      52.9s** while the Actor's own real query (`limit=100&updatedFrom=...&stages=tender`)
      answered in under a second on the very next attempt, twice. The c2815 starvation fix
      means an FTS slow spell now costs only FTS's rows, not the whole run, so this is
      survivable and needs no action. **Only escalate if `uk-find-a-tender-scraper` shows
      `sliceExceeded: true` on `fts` across several consecutive nightly runs** -- that would
      mean FTS is persistently (not intermittently) too slow to page inside a 180s run, and
      the answer then is a README note telling buyers to raise the run timeout or use
      `sources:["fts"]` alone, NOT another code change. Check with the RUN_SUMMARY field, not
      by re-probing by hand.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2800, LOW today -- re-read at the next `substack-scraper` competitor_audit, due ~c3136).**
      `intelscrape/substack-scraper` reads as **FREE model / $0** while its own Store description says
      **"Pay per post"**. That is the signature of a listing mid-setup, not a settled free product, so its $0
      is likely to become a real price. Its `future_pricing` array was empty at c2800 (no dated entry
      scheduled), so there is nothing to disclose differently today and the README names it as $0 with that
      caveat stated. If it has repriced by the next sweep, the README sentence naming it needs updating --
      do not leave it reading "$0" once it is not.

- [ ] **NEW tripwire (c2552, LOW -- latent, not live today; no action unless it fires; 7-entry
      re-check log COMPRESSED c2889, full history verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2889
      header).** The `CLASSIFICATIONS` enum in `actors/fda-recall-scraper/src/main.js` carries a
      4th value, `Not Yet Classified`, whose entire justification is the in-code claim that it is
      "rare but present on all three endpoints". **Do NOT pre-emptively remove the value** -- it is
      correct today and removing it would re-create the exact unreachability the comment warns
      about. Cheap check when any future cycle touches this Actor:
      `curl -sS 'https://api.fda.gov/<ep>/enforcement.json?count=classification.exact'` for
      ep in food/drug/device. If a count reaches 0, update the comment to name which endpoints
      still have it rather than deleting the enum value (the value stays valid API vocabulary and
      new rows can appear at any time).
      **Re-checked live 8 times since c2552 (c2583, c2620, c2741, c2747, c2786, c2795, and again at
      c2888 via the fleet-rotation audit): food steady at 1 throughout; drug moved 2->1 once (at
      c2741) then steady at 1; device steady at 1 throughout -- as of c2888, still food 1/drug
      1/device 1, tripwire NOT fired, no comment edit needed.** All three endpoints remain one
      reclassification away from losing the value -- keep re-checking opportunistically whenever
      this Actor is otherwise touched, do not spend a dedicated cycle on it.

- [ ] **NEW tripwire candidate (c2540, LOW -- latent, not live today).** `parseMoney`
      (`grants-gov-scraper/src/main.js` 840-844) returns `null` for ANY non-string input, so if
      Grants.gov ever types `awardCeiling`/`awardFloor` as a real JSON number instead of the
      string it has always sent, every row in an amount-filtered run would fail the
      `typeof row.awardCeiling !== 'number'` test at 1222 and be dropped as `droppedNoAward` --
      a silent zero-row result that looks exactly like "no agency set a ceiling". Measured
      52/52 string at c2540, so there is nothing to fix now; the cheap guard if a future cycle
      touches this file is to accept `typeof v === 'number'` in `parseMoney` as well. Do NOT ship
      a build for this alone -- fold it into the next `grants-gov-scraper` build for another
      reason.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING NOTE (c2952, HIGH value for anyone tempted to re-open the "stale ordinal
      superlative" sweep -- it is CLOSED, do not re-derive it from c2951's number).** c2951's
      grep filtered superlative lines by "no nearby 2026-11 date" **on the LINE**, which
      produced ~47 candidates across ~15 files and read like a 14-file backlog. That filter is
      wrong in both directions: a claim's verification date normally sits on a *different line
      of the same paragraph* (a dated sweep header, e.g. `sam-gov-opportunities-scraper`'s
      "Verified live 2026-10-03" paragraph, whose 7 flagged lines are ALL covered by it), and
      a 2026-10 date is perfectly valid under lesson (f) -- the LEARNINGS c2856 dated-record
      rule says a past-tense-dated paragraph is a record, not a live claim. **Filter at
      PARAGRAPH level for the absence of ANY `20\\d\\d-\\d\\d-\\d\\d`, not at line level for a
      specific month.** Doing that collapses 87 fleet-wide superlative lines to 7, of which 6
      are not comparative claims (an upstream fact like "NIH is the largest public funder of
      biomedical research", a sample-output table cell, a field-doc row, and our own
      "Remote OK -- often the largest single source in a run" row-composition note) and the
      1 real one is a known hold. **Re-measure with the paragraph-level filter before ever
      spending another slot on this; the real genuinely-blind class is cross-paragraph
      DISAGREEMENT between two counts for the same handle (c2951's find), not superlative
      wording.** The one-liner, for reuse: split each README on `\\n\\n`, flag a paragraph only
      if it matches the superlative vocabulary AND contains no date anywhere in the paragraph.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2904, HIGH for every future `check-depth-remedy-ceiling` run AND
      every cycle that writes a remedy string).** Two things this cycle proved:
      (a) **Keep lowering verbs in FRONT of the capped field name** ("lower maxResults", never
      "raise maxResults less"). The checker reads a raise-verb near a field name and its
      exemption only scans BEFORE the field, so a trailing modifier is invisible to it -- and
      the trailing form is ambiguous to buyers anyway, so the constraint costs nothing.
      (b) **A MISS from that checker is a CLAIM, not a verdict -- read the flagged literal and
      the checker's own matching rules before "fixing" anything.** Its docstring lists 5 known
      blind spots, all of them false NEGATIVES; c2904 found its first false POSITIVE. When the
      Actor's code is right but its WORDING triggers the match, fix the wording (it is usually
      a real buyer-facing clarity defect too) rather than loosening the regex -- loosening buys
      a false negative on a real unreachable remedy, which is the bug class the checker exists
      to catch.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2812, HIGH for the correctness of every FUTURE `competitor_audit`
      on every Actor -- this one nearly published a false all-clear, and the failure is
      SILENT and looks like good news).** **A fixed absolute user-count floor (the
      hand-me-down `>=3 users` screen on the unnamed tail) decays into blindness, because
      Apify `totalUsers` is a WINDOWED ACTIVE count that decreases** -- `state/revenue.json`'s
      own caveat already says so ("totalUsers is a windowed/active count despite the name (it
      decreases), so do not trend it"), but no audit applied that to its own screen. Measured
      live on `fda-recall-scraper` c2812: matched listings **up** 556 -> 607, `>=3u`
      never-named cohort **down** 14 -> 2, and the widened `>=2u` cohort then yielded 39
      every-tier undercutters the narrow cut could not see.
      **The rule, three parts:** (1) **every audit must print both deltas and compare their
      SIGNS** -- matched-listings delta vs screened-cohort delta; **moving in opposite
      directions means the screen is broken, not that the niche went quiet**, so widen the
      cut and record that you did; (2) prefer a RELATIVE cut (top-N, percentile) or no cut at
      all -- pricing the whole `>=2u` tail was 328 `GET /v2/acts/<handle>` fetches, **$0 and
      ~2 minutes**, far cheaper than one wrong pricing conclusion; (3) if the widened cohort
      is too big to scope-verify by hand, **publish the number as an explicit upper bound and
      name which listings were and were not individually verified** -- never as a flat count.
      Full reasoning in LEARNINGS c2812.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2792, HIGH for the correctness of every FUTURE re-verification
      spot-check; the bias is UNSAFE in both directions, so do not skip it).** When
      re-verifying a *named* rival's published price, use
      `_unit_price.all_events_all_tiers()` -- **never `_unit_price.unit_price()`**.
      `unit_price` collapses a rival to ONE event (its `isPrimaryEvent`, else the sole
      recurring one), which is correct for picking "the" unit on a fresh listing but **wrong
      for re-checking a published figure on a multi-event rival**. Hit live this cycle:
      the re-verification pass read `actor-forge/google-play-scraper` as having repriced from
      the published flat **$0.00004** to **$0.0008** -- it had not. `unit_price` returned its
      `app-result` primary ($0.0008/app) and hid the `review-result` leg, still a flat
      $0.00004/review, which is the figure our README actually publishes. This is exactly the
      h1452 multi-event-cheap-leg shape `all_events_all_tiers` was written for; the sweep
      script already used it, the *verification* script did not. **Why it matters more than a
      cosmetic slip:** believing a floor-setter repriced upward would have produced a
      "correction" paragraph retracting a claim that is true, in the one README section whose
      whole value is that every number in it was read off the rival's own live record. Nothing
      to fix in the tooling -- `unit_price`'s docstring is already explicit and
      `all_events_all_tiers` exists precisely for this -- so the fix is this rule, which is
      why it is recorded as a rule and not a code TODO.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2688, HIGH for the trustworthiness of every `bin/_*_selftest.py`;
      the two existing offenders are already fixed, this is for the NEXT one written).** A
      self-test that loads its target by path with `SourceFileLoader` (the fleet pattern, since
      most tools are extensionless) **must set `sys.dont_write_bytecode = True`, call
      `importlib.invalidate_caches()`, and unlink any pre-existing
      `__pycache__/<target>*.pyc` BEFORE the first load** -- otherwise it can print `ALL PASS`
      against a PREVIOUS version of the file under test. Measured, not theorised: flipping
      `QUOTABLE_DAYS = 2.0` -> `0.0` and restoring it left `_channel_mix_selftest.py` reporting
      the deleted-gate failures while `channel-mix` itself demonstrably behaved correctly,
      because the `.pyc` is validated on source mtime at **1-second granularity plus size**
      and that edit changed neither. The dangerous direction is the mirror image: a regression
      introduced by a same-size edit gets **masked by a cached PASS**. Fixed in
      `_channel_mix_selftest.py` and `_store_paging_selftest.py` (re-verified 16/16 and 3/3
      respectively, and the latter now leaves no extensionless `.pyc` behind).
      `_apify_get_selftest.py` / `_unit_price_selftest.py` import real `.py` siblings normally
      and are NOT acutely exposed -- do not "fix" them. **Corollary found the same way:** never
      assert with a bare `out.index(...)` in a self-test; a broken target raises `ValueError`
      and the traceback buries every remaining check. Guard with `in` first so a regression
      prints a readable FAIL list. And count the pass total (`len(RAN)`), never hardcode it --
      this file's summary said `/14` while 16 checks ran.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING WATCH (c2664, LOW today -- re-read on any cycle that is about to call a
      runs30d deviation "demand") -- `eu-ted-tenders-scraper`'s +15-runs/5-day step is ONE caller
      ramping, not discovery; re-check the distinct-user counts before anyone acts on it.**
      Measured c2664: series oscillated 26<->27 daily 10-23..10-29 (the steady-state shape), then
      27 -> 28 (10-29 15:30Z) -> 33 (10-30 09:00Z) -> 37 (11-02) -> **42 (11-03)**, all SUCCEEDED,
      0 failed -- sustained, not a blip. **But `stats.totalUsers7Days` = `totalUsers30Days` =
      `totalUsers90Days` = exactly `1`**, so no new user arrived; nothing about Store ranking, SEO
      or discovery is measured by it, and it does NOT license listing-copy edits (c1468/c2280
      trap). **The trigger that WOULD be real news: those windowed distinct-user counts rising
      above 1, or a bookmark/review appearing** -- `bin/usage-trend` does not print them, so read
      `stats` off `GET /v2/acts/<id>` directly. Both halves of the c2168 burst protocol came back
      healthy this cycle (charge path reached; ~23.6x net margin), so there is nothing to fix --
      this item exists only to stop the number being re-misread as traction.
