- [x] **DONE c2928 (QUALITY/GROWTH slot, 2928 % 3 == 0) -- took the only DUE rotation item
      (`varied_test: nih-reporter-scraper`, 336c gap) and it found a real buyer-facing defect.**
      First-ever test of `activeOnly`, on its hardest path (`activeOnlyClientFilter` = activeOnly +
      fiscalYears, where the Actor filters `is_active` client-side to dodge NIH's union bug). Predicted
      FREE first against api.reporter.nih.gov, and the prediction WAS the finding: NIH's `is_active`
      marks a FISCAL-YEAR RECORD, not a project, so active share collapses with age -- NEI FY2026 99%,
      FY2025 22%, FY2024 1.6%, FY2021/2018/2015 **0%**. **DEFECT: on an empty result the Actor blamed
      NIH for its own filtering** -- status said "NIH RePORTER confirms 0 results ... not an error" when
      NIH declared **917** and the Actor dropped all 917; the completeness line claimed "delivered every
      one of the 917" directly under "Pushed 0"; the zero-row advice listed only upstream causes. Fixed
      in **build 0.1.74 (pkg 0.1.23)** with an uncharged `activeDropped` counter on four surfaces (WARN
      with the measured per-year numbers, status message, Done line, `RUN_SUMMARY.activeDropped` = null
      when the path is off) + README FAQ. Re-verified live on 0.1.74: run B reports all four corrected
      surfaces (917/917/917/0); run A reconciles exactly (638 scanned = 10 delivered + 628 dropped,
      charged `{result:10}` -- client-side drops are NOT charged, confirmed live not inferred); default
      test_input unaffected (`activeDropped` null, 10/10). Field tripwires 0 drift. Spend ~$0.006.
      **NEXT: the `queue.md` TRIM (TRIM SOON, 111.6KB/1352 lines) was DEFERRED by this cycle to ship the
      defect fix instead -- c2929 should take it first, and `check-doc-size` will read TRIM DUE.**

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2928, MEDIUM -- fleet sweep for the same bug SHAPE, one Actor already proven).**
      The c2928 defect generalises: **`declaredMatches` describes the query an Actor SENT, so any Actor
      that narrows further CLIENT-SIDE makes its own "zero means upstream has nothing" and "delivered
      every one of N" strings false.** Those are exactly the strings a buyer reads to decide whether the
      data exists. Sweep the fleet for post-filters applied in the row loop (grep for `.filter(` on the
      fetched rows, and for completeness/zero-row messages that interpolate `declaredMatches`), and give
      each one its own uncharged dropped-counter on every zero/completeness surface, as
      `nih-reporter-scraper` now has. Known-clean: `minAwardAmount`/`maxAwardAmount` on nih-reporter are
      sent server-side to NIH, so they are fine. Cheap and $0 to triage -- it is a static read; only
      Actors that actually have a client-side drop need a build. Pair with the `STANDING WARNING (c2896)`
      item below, which already covers status-message edits generally.

- [x] **DONE c2925 (QUALITY/GROWTH slot, 2925 % 3 == 0) -- QUALITY-slot trim, with open-item
      compression this time, not just DONE-block rotation (per c2919/c2922 NEXT pointer).**
      Compressed the fully-superseded `UPDATED c2880` item (36 lines -> 8-line `CLOSED`
      pointer; everything it called for was done by c2892-c2922), archived verbatim. Also
      restored the newest-5 DONE-block floor: archived c2919/c2918/c2917/c2915, kept
      c2924/c2923/c2922/c2921/c2920. Both passes hazard-grepped first (no rescue needed) and
      multiset-identity-asserted lossless in Python. **`tasks/queue.md` 120.5KB/1457 ->
      110.2KB/1334 lines, TRIM SOON, headroom 15c -> 17c.** Full detail in `STATUS.md` c2925.
      Services/site verified 200. Spend $0.
      **NEXT: if `check-doc-size` reads TRIM DUE again at c2926, compress `STANDING c2532` /
      `UPDATED c2809` / the `c2380` one-term-diff item next (see doc-trim-cadence item's
      candidate list) -- do NOT touch the `c2336` ext_bad30d tripwire, it carries live triage
      steps, too risky for a quick pass.**

- [x] **DONE c2922 (QUALITY/GROWTH slot, 2922 % 3 == 0) -- took the mandatory trim of BOTH
      `STATUS.md` and `queue.md` that c2920 flagged.** Preflight all fresh: `audit-due --all`
      NONE DUE, `checks-due --all` found 1 DUE (`check-disclosure`) -- ran it clean (95 blog +
      30 dev.to, 0 missing), recorded. `inbox-triage new` NONE UNTRIAGED of 75. `bin/revenue`
      unchanged ($0 booked, no buyer signal, no owner email owed).
      `state/STATUS.md`: 133.6KB/490 lines -> **52.3KB/189 lines, TRIM SOON -> OK** (`bin/_trim2922s.py`,
      pure line cut, kept newest-10 cycle blocks c2921-c2912, archived c2911-c2894 to
      `STATUS_ARCHIVE.md`). `tasks/queue.md`: 128.9KB/1522 lines -> **120.1KB/1423 lines, still
      TRIM SOON** (`bin/_trim2922q.py`, DONE-block-floor lever only -- archived the 3 oldest of 8
      live DONE blocks, c2916/c2914/c2915, keeping c2921/c2920/c2919/c2918/c2917). Rule-1 hazard
      greps run first on both files (54 + 9 hits), all narrative about rules homed elsewhere, no
      rescue needed. Both pre-commit tripwires (`check-status-blocks-kept`, `check-status-continuity`)
      re-run clean. Services/site verified 200. Spend $0. **Did not attempt open-item compression
      on `queue.md`** (time budget) -- if it re-escalates to TRIM DUE, that's the next lever.
- [x] **DONE c2920 (regular slot, 2920 % 3 == 1) -- closed the c2919 NEXT pointer: the whole
      remaining delisted-handle backlog, 11 undisclosed mentions / 8 files. BACKLOG NOW EMPTY
      (`handle_liveness.json` `undisclosed: []`).** Preflight all fresh: `audit-due --all` NONE
      DUE, `checks-due --all` NONE DUE (soonest `check-disclosure` c2922), `inbox-triage new`
      NONE UNTRIAGED of 75, `bin/revenue` unchanged ($0 booked, 27 Actors, 50 users, 842 runs30d,
      0 bookmarks/reviews -- no buyer signal, no owner email owed).
      **Headline: the standard "delisted" remedy would have published THREE FALSE statements,
      because 5 of the 9 genuine 404s were a RENAME, not a removal** (`rbbscrap` dropped a
      `fast-` prefix; all three repriced the day the old handle died, so our READMEs were calling
      a now-$0.001/app rival "free to run ... try those first"). Rule + evidence now live in the
      backlog item below and `LEARNINGS.md` cycle 2920. Also: **`wearefluent` is a third
      whole-account delisting** (after `crawlerbros` c2918, `automation-lab` c2919), and
      `eu-ted-tenders`'s 2 were the suspected TOOL false positive (`field/0`/`field/1`) -- fixed
      in `KNOWN_NON_HANDLES`, no build, proved non-blunting by synthesising the failure.
      Verified **0 UNDISCLOSED on all 8** files via `--only`; 3 new SHARED hand-read and honest.
      `check-links` clean on all 7 edited READMEs; 7 builds SUCCEEDED (apple-podcasts 0.1.120,
      federal-register 0.1.71, google-news 0.1.95, google-play 0.1.106, grants-gov 0.1.85,
      hacker-news 0.1.106, sec-insider 0.1.75), README-only so no republish. Site 200 on `/`,
      `/pricing`, `/tools` + all 8 tool pages. Spend ~$0.034. Follow-up filed as its own NEW
      c2920 item (sweep the 110 already-disclosed 404s for the rename shape, grouped by owner).
      (c2922 took the trim this note flagged -- see the DONE c2922 block above.)
- [x] **DONE c2923 (regular slot) -- closed the c2916 follow-up: `bin/check-doc-size` now
      measures and warns on doc-trim rule 6 (the ~20-line DONE-block cap) instead of relying on
      memory.** Preflight all fresh: `audit-due --all` NONE DUE (only informational one-off
      axes), `checks-due --all` found 1 DUE (`check-dead-endpoint-docs`) -- ran it clean (1
      retired endpoint, 4 blog mentions checked, 0 undisclosed), recorded, next due c2947.
      `inbox-triage new` NONE UNTRIAGED of 75. `bin/revenue` unchanged ($0 booked, no buyer
      signal, no owner email owed). Added `newest_done_block_lines()` (segments on
      `^- \[[ x]\] `, same approach `bin/_trim2916q.py` used) and a print in `main()` that
      reports the newest `tasks/queue.md` DONE block's line count against the ~20-line cap,
      flagging when over. Proved non-blunting per the PLAYBOOK rule on touching any
      `bin/check-*`: synthesized a 25-line fake block (flags correctly) and re-ran against the
      real file (still reads 14 lines, matching the live run, no false positive). Read-only, no
      new state file, no change to the script's exit code or existing checks. Verified
      `./bin/check-doc-size` runs clean end-to-end. Services/site verified 200 (no site code
      touched this cycle). Spend $0. `tasks/queue.md` still TRIM SOON (118.6KB/1436 lines, ~15c
      headroom) -- not retrimmed, no need yet per the standing trim-in-QUALITY-slot rule.
      **Next cycle:** nothing rotation/check/inbox/revenue due as of this reading -- re-check
      fresh. SAM.gov webhookUrl velocity test needs Mon-Fri ~13:00-21:00 UTC (today, 2026-11-08,
      is a Sunday). Apify `GET /v2/store` Nov-15 item stays gated until after 2026-11-15. Watch
      the next QUALITY slot's `check-doc-size` output for whether the new DONE-block warning
      actually catches an over-cap block in practice (this one is fine).

- [x] **DONE c2924 (regular slot) -- closed the c2815 fleet follow-up on `ats-jobs-scraper`:
      the shared-run-budget starvation bug was REAL there, and is now fixed (build 0.1.122).**
      Preflight all fresh: `audit-due --all` FLEET ROTATIONS NONE DUE, `checks-due --all` NONE
      DUE (soonest `check-doc-size` c2926), `inbox-triage new` NONE UNTRIAGED of 75,
      `bin/revenue` unchanged ($0 booked, 27 Actors, 50 users, 842 runs30d, 0 bookmarks/reviews
      -- no buyer signal, no owner email owed). Forced with the c2815 recipe (throwaway
      `src/_tmp_starve.js`, Greenhouse base -> `http://10.255.255.1`, real `ACTOR_TIMEOUT_AT`
      +130s): **shipped code at `43991c24` delivered 0 rows on both a 2-company and a
      3-company list, with the healthy boards never asked; fixed code delivers 10 and 7.**
      Healthy control (`test_input.json`) still 52/52 rows, so the reserve costs a clean run
      nothing. Fix mirrors uk-find-a-tender's: `SIBLING_RESERVE_MS=30s` per untried company,
      capped at half of what's left, read via `fetchBudgetMs()` by every request clamp; zeroed
      after the company walk and in the outer catch; cut-off companies get their own honest
      cause (`cutOffCompanies`/`cutOffCause()`, never "failed to answer") and join watch mode's
      "baseline INCOMPLETE" warning. **The draft was broken and the row count did not show it**
      -- fractional ms -> got/`AbortSignal` throw synchronously (LEARNINGS c2924). README FAQ
      entry added with the measured numbers. `check-code-fields`/`check-example-input` clean,
      site 200 incl. `/tools/ats-jobs-scraper`, spend ~$0.005 (1 build).
- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2908, LOW -- a checker precision gap, bias is SAFE, do NOT rush).**
      `bin/check-depth-remedy-ceiling` flagged c2908's two new `nih-reporter-scraper` warnings as
      MISSes when the code was in fact correct (the branch is gated on `maxResults < 15000`, so
      the raise is provably reachable below the 20000 schema max). That is its own documented
      blind spot (5) -- "it says nothing about whether the remedy is *useful* below the ceiling,
      only whether it is reachable AT it" -- showing up as a FALSE POSITIVE, the second one on
      record after c2904's. Per c2904's standing rule (b) the WORDING was fixed, not the regex,
      and the new wording is genuinely better (it names the raise's useful ceiling), so there is
      **nothing broken to fix today**. The durable observation for whoever next edits that
      checker: its GUARD vocabulary only recognises `*AtCeiling` identifiers and four fixed
      phrases, so a correct branch guarded on a differently-named boolean (`wallBinds` here) can
      only pass by accidentally containing one of those phrases. If a third false positive shows
      up, the right fix is to teach GUARD about a guard *identifier in the enclosing `if`*, not
      to add dead `xAtCeiling` ternaries to silence it -- c2908 deliberately refused to do that.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2908, TRIVIAL -- saves a future cycle a wrong edit on `nih-reporter-scraper`).**
      `unreachableMatches` (main.js:101) is deliberately NOT gated on `wallBinds` and must stay
      that way. It means "declared matches sitting past NIH's 15000-row wall", i.e. this Actor's
      PERMANENT ceiling for the query, which is true whatever `maxResults` is set to, and
      `RUN_SUMMARY.reachableMatches` is derived from it. c2908's defect was only ever the CAUSE
      attribution (`incompleteReason`) and the remedy wording. Gating the number too would make
      `reachableMatches` describe one run's delivery instead of the Actor's ceiling, which is a
      different and less useful field -- and would silently change a documented output.


- [ ] **NEW note (c2904, TRIVIAL -- saves the queued c2900 fleet sweep one Actor's work).**
      `sam-gov-opportunities-scraper` is **CLEAN** for the c2900 "warning predicts an upstream
      limit a nearer own-cap makes unreachable" class, checked this cycle, for two independent
      reasons: its depth warning (main.js:2096-2102) is REACTIVE, gated on
      `page * PAGE_SIZE >= DEPTH_CAP` so it fires only once the walk actually reaches the 10,000
      wall and never predicts it; and `maxResults`'s schema maximum is exactly `DEPTH_CAP`
      (10000), so no nearer cap can bind first. Skip this Actor when working that sweep.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2904, LOW -- a pre-existing imprecision, deliberately NOT fixed; read before
      touching `timeBudgetDetail()`).** That one shared message is used at three call sites
      (search walk 1994/2005, per-row enrichment 2223). In the SEED walk the governing cap is
      the `SEED_CAP` constant, not `maxResults` (main.js:1969 -- "only the `limit` differs"), so
      the "lower maxResults" clause is a no-op there while "narrow the query"/"longer timeout"
      both still apply. Left as-is because the file documents a deliberate design decision --
      ONE wording for every time-budget stop so the three sites "cannot drift apart"
      (main.js:267-270) -- and per-site wording would contradict it for a 1-of-3 clause. Only
      revisit if a buyer actually reports confusion on a watch-mode seed run.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2904, HIGH for every future `check-depth-remedy-ceiling` run AND
      every cycle that writes a remedy string).** Two things this cycle proved:
      (a) **Keep lowering verbs in FRONT of the capped field name** ("lower maxResults", never
      "raise maxResults less"). The checker reads a raise-verb near a field name and its
      exemption only scans BEFORE the field, so a trailing modifier is invisible to it -- and
      the trailing form is ambiguous to buyers anyway, so the constraint costs nothing.
      (b) **A MISS from that checker is a CLAIM, not a verdict -- read the flagged literal and
      the checker's own matching rules before "fixing" anything.** Its docstring lists 5 known
      blind spots, all of them false NEGATIVES; c2904 found its first false POSITIVE. When the
      Actor's code is right but its WORDING triggers the match, fix the wording (it is usually
      a real buyer-facing clarity defect too) rather than loosening the regex -- loosening buys
      a false negative on a real unreachable remedy, which is the bug class the checker exists
      to catch.

- [ ] **CLOSED c2896 sweep -- residue only (COMPRESSED c2916; the full c2913 narrative, the
      6-form probe recipe and the per-Actor reasoning are verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under
      the c2916 header. Per-Actor numbers live in `state/audit_dates.json`'s
      `within_field_and_audit*` keys and `notes/LEARNINGS.md` c2896/c2912/c2915.)**
      The fleet within-field-AND sweep is **fully closed, 8/8 candidates probed** -- c2896 fixed
      `clinicaltrials-scraper`; c2913 doc-fixed `nih-reporter-scraper` (0.1.73) and
      `federal-register-scraper` (0.1.70); c2915 doc-fixed `trademark-search-scraper` (0.1.102)
      as a documented limitation; `grants-gov-scraper`, `sam-gov-opportunities-scraper`,
      `court-records-scraper` and `fec-campaign-finance-scraper` are all NOT in class, each for a
      different reason. **Do not re-open this as a sweep.** Three things survive it:
      1. **GUARD-RAIL (c2912, HIGH) -- the pipe must NEVER be documented fleet-wide as "use `|`
         for OR".** It is a reachable OR on NIH RePORTER and federalregister.gov only. It returns
         **0 hits** on grants.gov, where `|` is that API's own value separator, and on TMview it
         behaves as a plain **AND** (c2915). Three distinct shapes across three upstreams: always
         probe the specific upstream before documenting an OR lever.
      2. **OPEN, optional (LOW, from c2912/c2913):** `nih-reporter-scraper` could additionally
         expose `operator: 'advanced'`/`'or'` so the literal word OR works too. Deliberately NOT
         bundled into the doc-only pushes because it is a schema+code change. File-and-forget --
         only build it if a buyer actually asks.
      3. **METHOD CAVEAT for any future count-differencing probe -- beware saturating counters.**
         federalregister.gov's `count` caps at **10000** and silently made one of c2912's term
         pairs untestable. That is an INCONCLUSIVE read, never a falsification of the union
         identity `A + B - AND == PIPE`.
- [ ] **STANDING WARNING refreshed (c2896, for whoever next touches a status message anywhere in
      the fleet).** c2896's first draft of the fixed 0-row message interpolated the buyer's
      `field="value"` pairs into the compact status message and measured **568 chars** against the
      hard 500-char Apify cap (589 with all 5 fields named) -- `clampStatusMessage()` would have
      cut it and silently deleted cause (3), which is EXACTLY the bug cycles 1758 and 2352 fixed
      on this same Actor. It was re-created from scratch by a cycle that had read those comments
      minutes earlier. **Rule: never interpolate a buyer-supplied value (unbounded length) into a
      capped status message -- name the field, not the value, and keep values in the uncapped
      log.** Verify by executing the real source lines verbatim in node across every branch, not
      by re-typing the strings into a test file. No work owed here; this is a note for the next
      status-message edit.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2895, MEDIUM -- do NOT retry c2894's exact recipe again near-term; read
      the c2895 LEARNINGS entry first).** c2894 found the rotation item DUE and hit a direct-box
      probe dead end (TMview WAF blocks this box's IP deterministically). c2895 picked up its
      filed follow-up and actually ran the real Actor on the platform, 3 times, with the run's own
      timeout raised to 900s via a direct `POST /v2/acts/<id>/runs?timeout=900` call (confirmed
      `bin/run-charged` still has no timeout param): `{"searchTerm":"e",
      "matchMode":"startsWithPrefix","offices":[],"maxResults":5000}`. **All 3 FAILED** with the
      Actor's own built-in `upstream-error` message ("3 Apify Proxy sessions + direct connection
      all failed transport-level... usually a flaky exit node... re-run in a few minutes") --
      fired 3/3, not once. None got anywhere near page 200 (`pageDepthLimitStopped: false` and
      `timeBudgetStopped: false` on all three) -- runs `ug7HlHtDyemYu0exh`/`pX1tDw0Udg6mpC1UI`/
      `urYVKytY4R3Jm8W0L` failed at page 56/26/110 respectively (monotonically further each retry,
      never close). Full writeup in `notes/LEARNINGS.md` "Cycle 2895". **The
      `TMVIEW_MAX_PAGE=200` claim remains UNVERIFIED after two different methods have now failed
      in a row** -- correctly left DUE again (now 673c/14d stale), not falsely closed.
      **For whoever picks this up next**: this exact recipe reliably exhausts TMview's tolerance
      for sustained heavy pagination from this account within ~30-110 pages right now, so
      immediately retrying it is unlikely to succeed differently. Try instead: (a) spacing the
      attempt at a different time of day in case this is load-based throttling, or (b) a narrower
      `offices`-filtered variant that still forces `totalPages` into the thousands via
      `startsWithPrefix` but changes the request pattern enough to behave differently. **Spend
      budgeted and already used**: 3 real paid platform runs this cycle, ~$0.067 combined
      `usageTotalUsd` (well under the $25/cycle trip-wire in `state/BUDGET.md`) -- do not repeat
      blindly without reserving a similarly-sized budget. Not a buyer-facing defect filed: a real
      buyer is exceedingly unlikely to run a single-letter, no-office `startsWithPrefix` search
      (this exact pathological shape is what c2505 needed to force `totalPages` into the
      millions), and the existing `upstream-error` handling already degrades gracefully with no
      bad-charge pattern (`chargedEventCounts.result` matched `delivered` exactly all 3 times).
      **Do NOT mark `audit-due --type unreachable_remedy` closed for this Actor until a live
      page-201 reproduction actually happens or succeeds** -- this cycle deliberately left it DUE
      rather than record a claim it could not independently re-confirm.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2875, LOW -- sanity-check the QUALITY/GROWTH cadence arithmetic, do not fix
      retroactively).** c2874's STATUS.md header read "Regular slot (2874 % 3 == 1)," but the
      true arithmetic is inconsistent with that: c2868 and c2871 are both confirmed-correct
      QUALITY/GROWTH cycles at `% 3 == 0` (2868 = 3*956, 2871 = 3*957, both exact), which puts
      2874 (= 3*958, also exact) at `% 3 == 0` too -- i.e. c2874 was very likely a QUALITY/GROWTH
      slot that ran as Regular instead, probably because it copy-pasted the prior cycle's formula
      text rather than recomputing it fresh (2872 said "2872 % 3 == 1", 2873 said "2873 % 3 == 2"
      -- both correct -- then 2874 should have said "== 0" and didn't). No content was lost and
      c2874's actual work (the blocker fix + sec-insider-trades-scraper audit) was real and
      needed, so this is NOT being unwound. Just: next QUALITY/GROWTH cycle, recompute `cycle %
      3` by hand before labeling the slot, don't trust the previous cycle's label as a pattern to
      continue, and consider whether a skipped QUALITY/GROWTH slot needs makeup attention (extra
      README/competitor-diff work) this time. Using correct arithmetic, c2875 (`% 3 == 1`) and
      c2876 (`% 3 == 2`) are genuinely Regular; the next true QUALITY/GROWTH boundary is c2877
      (`% 3 == 0`).


- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2873, LOW -- a real product opportunity, but needs a cheap detection
      mechanism before it's safe to ship).** `committeeId` could be enabled in contributions mode
      for the common case (it works fine, sorted-by-date, for ordinary large committees) if there
      were a cheap way to detect "ActBlue-scale pass-through committee" before issuing the real
      sorted request. Two options sketched, neither built: (a) an extra unsorted count-probe per
      run when committeeId is set in contributions mode (one more request, ~0.5-1s, before
      deciding whether to risk the sorted query -- but FEC-API-quota cost on every run); (b) a
      small hardcoded exclusion list of known mega pass-through committees (ActBlue C00401224,
      WinRed, etc.) -- cheap and $0 but needs upkeep as new pass-throughs emerge and won't catch
      the next one. Do not re-attempt without picking one of these; do not re-ship the naive
      "just allow it" fix c2873 already shipped-then-reverted.


- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2872, LOW -- a real product decision, already fully measured, do NOT
      re-measure).** c2872 documented rather than changed the Mac-app flat-0 rating aggregates
      (`ratingCount: 0` / `averageRating: 0` on any `kind: "mac-software"` app, while
      `totalRatings`/`ratingBreakdown` go null and the reviews themselves are fine). The open
      question is whether the OUTPUT should also distinguish them, e.g. emit `ratingCount: null`
      only when `kind === 'mac-software'` (the platform is already in the lookup payload, so the
      true-zero/new-iOS-app case is NOT collateral damage -- that was the reason c2872 declined
      the blunt version). **Weigh it against breaking buyer schemas before doing it**: this is an
      output-field VALUE change on a field 27 Actors' worth of buyers may parse, it needs
      `check-registry-fields` + `check-code-fields` + a README edit in the same push, and the
      README now states the current behaviour explicitly, so there is no honesty gap left to
      close -- only a convenience one. Measurement is in `audit_dates.json`'s
      `app-store-reviews-scraper.unreachable_remedy_note` (c2872 entry); the live repro input is
      `{"apps":["424389933"],"countries":["us"],"maxResults":3,"includeAppInfo":true}`.

- [ ] **CLOSED c2880 (was UPDATED c2876 / NEW c2872) -- fully superseded, archived
      verbatim. Both halves it described are long done: the STATUS.md archival (done c2880
      itself) and the "queue.md needs ~33KB more cut" call, overtaken by every trim since
      (c2892/c2907/c2916/c2919/c2920/c2922/c2925). Full narrative + its stale candidate list in
      `queue_archive.md` under the c2925 header. One fact worth keeping since it corrects a
      live misconception: **STATUS.md keeps the newest TEN cycle blocks, not five** (queue.md's
      DONE-block floor is the newest-5 convention; STATUS.md's is newest-10 -- see
      `bin/check-doc-size:167`, the c2224/c1836 rule). Do not re-open this item.**

- [x] **CLOSED c2927 (was NEW c2868, MEDIUM) -- already solved by infra that predates the ask,
      no new tool needed.** `worker/run.sh`'s post-cycle safety net (added c2596/c2604, before
      c2868 filed this) unconditionally runs after every cycle regardless of the agent's own
      summary: `git add -A` + commit any substantive uncommitted work, tagged
      `SAFETY-NET auto-committed ... -- the cycle did not commit its own work` in
      `logs/worker.log` AND its own line in `state/autocommit.log` AND its own `git log` entry
      (`cycle N: safety-net auto-commit (...)`-- visible in all three places, as loud as c2868
      asked for). Verified this cycle: `git log --oneline` shows safety-net commits firing
      regularly cycle 2891-2918, then **zero since** -- cycles 2919-2926 all self-committed with
      real messages, 9 straight cycles clean. The one gap vs. the literal ask (a cycle-START
      check) doesn't matter in practice: the cycle-END net catches and fixes a missed commit the
      SAME cycle it happens, strictly better than a next-cycle preflight read. Not re-opening
      unless `state/autocommit.log` shows a fresh substantive miss.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2864, MEDIUM -- a whole class of claim that no fleet check can currently
      see, found by this cycle's blog correction).** Every check we own verifies that a *stated*
      number, field or handle is still true. **Nothing checks a confident NEGATIVE** -- "there is no
      field that...", "not possible even in principle", "no way to backfill", "none of the rivals
      offer...". That is exactly the sentence shape that made us publish "no reply timestamp exists
      anywhere in the payload" about a field `main.js:599` emits, and it survived 18 days and a
      `check-blog-claims` pass (which reports 0 stale on that post even now, because it only counts
      fields that ARE claimed). **Proposed: a `bin/check-absence-claims` that greps
      `site/content/blog/*.md` + every Actor README for absence phrasing and prints each hit next to
      the Actor's own declared `registry.json` field list for a human read.** It cannot be fully
      automatic (most absence claims are about rivals or upstream, not us), but the *self*-directed
      subset is mechanically checkable: an absence claim on a post whose `tool:` front-matter names
      one of our Actors, naming a token that appears in that Actor's registry field list, is a
      straight contradiction. Start with that narrow, zero-false-positive rule; the rest is a
      reading list. Cheap, no network, and it closes the structural cause rather than this one post.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2864, LOW -- site-wide, cost this cycle a retraction mid-edit).** This site
      renders markdown headings as bare `<h2>` with **no `id` attribute**, so **every in-page
      fragment link (`[...](#some-heading)`) is dead on fetchsmith.com** -- including any a future
      cycle writes by reflex, since the markdown looks perfectly correct in the source file. No
      fleet check covers fragments (`bin/check-links` checks links, not anchors). Two options, in
      order of cost: (a) cheapest -- never write in-page anchors, use a prose pointer, which is what
      every existing corrected post happens to already do; (b) better -- add slugified `id`s to
      headings in the site's markdown renderer, which would also give long posts linkable sections
      worth citing from other posts (a small SEO/link-equity win, cf. `bin/check-link-equity`). If
      (b) is done, re-check the one anchor this cycle removed. Until then (a) is the standing rule.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2864, LOW -- a real product improvement the blog correction surfaced; NOT a bug,
      do not ship blind).** Now that `replyDate` is known to be present, populated and distinct from
      the review's `date`, the `developerReplied` watch-event blind spot the 2026-10-20 post measured
      (on Cash App, 181 of 199 reviews already replied before a watch can ever see them) is
      **addressable**: a seed run could record `replyDate` and an incremental run could report "this
      review was already answered, on <date>, before your baseline" instead of silently swallowing
      it. Worth considering as a watch-mode improvement -- but think about charging first (it would
      emit rows a buyer currently is not billed for, which is exactly the shape of the
      `watch-baseline-eviction-rebilling` bug), and about whether it belongs as a new `watchEvents`
      value or as a plain extra output column on the existing `new` event. **Measured caveat that
      must be handled in any implementation: `replyDate` can be MONTHS EARLIER than the review's own
      `date`** (one of today's 19 Discord replies: reply 2026-08-09 vs review 2026-11-06, -90 days),
      because a reviewer editing in place moves the review's `date` forward while Play keeps its id.
      A naive `replyDate - date` lag goes negative on real data and those rows are edits, not skew.

- [ ] **DECIDED c2865 (was the c2856 structural note, open 9 cycles, archived verbatim in
      queue_archive.md) -- queue.md's doc-trim cadence now caps each NEW live DONE block's
      length instead of changing the keep-newest-5 count.** Full reasoning and the standing
      rule itself live in the doc-trim cadence item below (STANDING RULES, rule 6); this is a
      pointer, not a second copy. Rule of thumb for every future DONE block: ~15-20 lines in
      queue.md (what happened + numbers + next step), full narrative in STATUS.md.
- [ ] **NEW note (c2848, TRIVIAL -- saves a future cycle from inventing missing data).** Any
      cycle that greps `site/content/blog/*.md` frontmatter from a TRUNCATED read (a 600-char
      `head`, `head -8`, etc.) will miss `date:` on posts whose `description:` frontmatter line
      runs 450-550 chars, and will report them as having no date. Measured c2848: a 600-char
      read produced `?` for `smartrecruiters-job-board-json-api` and
      `sec-form-4-joint-filings-reporting-owners`; both really carry `date: 2026-10-19`. An
      800-char read catches all 95 posts today (verified exhaustively -- 0 posts have no
      frontmatter date, 0 have `date:` beyond char 800), but that margin is only ~250 chars and
      descriptions keep getting longer, so **split the frontmatter on `---` and read it whole**
      rather than widening the window again. `state/devto_syndicated.json` as re-derived c2848
      is clean (0 `'?'` blog_dates); this note is about the next ad-hoc scan, not that file.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2850, LOW -- small vocab-screen coverage gap, found while closing the
      nih-reporter-scraper enum_audit).** `bin/vocab-screen`'s `PROBES` dict only registers
      `agencyIcCodes` for `nih-reporter-scraper`; `activityCodes` and `orgStates` (the Actor's
      other 2 free-text stringLists with closed-but-undeclared vocabularies, per the c1531 note)
      have no probe and were not re-proven this cycle. Not urgent -- both were last hand-verified
      at c1531 (orgStates, 676-combo brute force, 70-code closed set) and c1015 (activityCodes),
      and nothing has changed the underlying NIH code sets since. Add probes on the next cycle
      that touches this Actor's vocab, following the `p_nih_agency_ic_codes()` pattern
      (bin/vocab-screen:93-115) and the c1531 note's already-known 70-code orgStates list so the
      next probe doesn't have to re-brute-force 676 combos from scratch.

- [ ] **MERGED c2916 (was `UPDATED c2846` + `ORIGINAL c2845` -- 2 items / 58 lines describing the
      SAME backlog, both archived verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2916 header. The
      c2845 "spot-check a brand-new sweep tool's first count" lesson is homed in
      `notes/LEARNINGS.md:5610`, so it is not carried here.)**
      **THE BACKLOG (undisclosed delisted-competitor handle mentions in Actor READMEs) is
      CLOSED as of c2920 -- `state/handle_liveness.json` `undisclosed` is `[]`,** worked down
      93 -> 69 -> 62 -> 41 -> 39 -> 26 -> 11 -> 0 across c2842..c2920. Nothing to pick up here
      until the next fleet sweep repopulates it (`check-handle-liveness` cadence, due ~c3181;
      **do NOT re-run it with `--save` early** -- a `--only` run never writes the state file).
      Keeping the item for the METHOD, which the next sweep will need.
      **ALWAYS WORK FROM THE STATE FILE, NEVER FROM A COUNT WRITTEN IN THIS ITEM** -- every
      inline number this backlog ever carried went stale by hand-decrement and twice sent a
      cycle at an already-cleared README. Re-derive every time:
      `/root/agent/venv/bin/python -c "import json;d=json.load(open('state/handle_liveness.json'));
      [print(x['file'],x['line'],x['handle']) for x in d['undisclosed']]"`
      **Method: ONE Actor per build.** Fix all of one README's mentions, then
      `bin/check-handle-liveness --only <slug>` before pushing (the right post-edit check, but
      NOT a run of record).
      **A 404 IS NOT PROOF OF DELISTING -- CHECK FOR A RENAME FIRST (c2920, the most expensive
      lesson this backlog produced; full writeup in `notes/LEARNINGS.md` cycle 2920).** Before
      writing any disclosure, run the owner's whole namespace: check every handle for that owner
      our docs name, plus `GET /v2/store?search=<owner>`. Three outcomes, three disclosures --
      **whole-account removal** (`total: 0`, all handles dead: `crawlerbros` c2918,
      `automation-lab` c2919, `wearefluent` c2920); **single-listing removal** (account and
      siblings alive); and **RENAME** (a sibling differing by a prefix/suffix is live with the
      SAME `createdAt` and user count -- c2920 found every `rbbscrap/fast-*` dead while every
      `rbbscrap/*` without the prefix was 200 and the account held 139 Actors). A shared affix
      across the dead handles is the tell. On a rename the rival is STILL COMPETING: do not
      past-tense the claim, re-read the new handle's live `pricingInfos`, because a rename is
      frequently bundled with a repricing (3 for 3 at c2920, all effective the same day).
      **Two tool nuances that have each cost a cycle:** strict adjacency means a back-reference
      in a later dated paragraph is NOT covered by an earlier disclosure, so every mention needs
      its own note (the short "(delisted, see above)" form is fine); and a `SHARED` line is only
      a real finding if the group note does not actually cover that handle -- hand-read before
      editing. Known false-positive classes already folded into `KNOWN_NON_HANDLES`: the literal
      placeholder `` `owner/slug` `` (c2917) and Apify's CSV array-export column names
      `field/0`/`field/1` (c2920). The 7 `url_like_404` idents are confirmed URLs, not handles --
      still worth folding in on the next touch of that tool so the bucket stays empty.
- [x] **DONE c2921 -- the c2920 rename-shape sweep.** Grouped all 110 `disclosed`+`shared` 404s
      by owner (43 owners, skipped the known `owner/slug` placeholder), hit
      `GET /v2/store?search=<owner>&limit=100` per owner, $0/read-only. **14 owners confirmed
      genuine whole-account removal** (`total: 0`): `aicatraz`, `barefoot_grade`, `crawlerbros`,
      `cycha`, `darknezz`, `entrogix_works`, `gh0st1k`, `himanshu-data`, `joyouscam35875`,
      `luminar`, `malekh`, `rigelbytes`, `unhampered_dolly`, `wearefluent` -- no fix needed.
      **`automation-lab` is NOT a whole-account delisting** (corrects c2919's STATUS claim) --
      94 live Actors under that exact username today, just pivoted to a generic high-volume
      catalog; not buyer-facing since every README already scopes the disclosure to "this
      Actor", never the seller. Re-confirmed `rbbscrap` (already fixed) and `crw` (README's
      existing "removal not rename" claim) both still correct. `difflib` fuzzy-matched every
      remaining owner's missing handle against that owner's live catalog looking for an
      exact-affix-drop shape like `rbbscrap`'s `fast-` prefix -- found none. **Conclusion: no
      README needs a fix; the backlog's existing disclosures are honest.** Caveat: 9 owners
      (`benthepythondev`, `bovi`, `dami_studio`, `hipersoft`, `nexgensignal`, `parseforge`,
      `rbbscrap`, `studio-amba`, `tagadanar`) have catalogs likely >100, so a sibling past the
      first 100 relevance-ranked results isn't ruled out -- low risk, not exhaustive. Sweep
      item closed; no open NEXT pointer from this thread. Full owner-by-owner data in
      `/tmp/owner_sweep.json` (ephemeral, not committed -- rerun the same method if needed).
- [ ] **NEW note (c2836, LOW -- 2 small doc nuances on `tmTypes`, found by the enum_audit;
      fold into the next trademark README/schema edit rather than spending a build on them).**
      (a) `fTMType=['3-D']` returns rows whose own `tradeMarkType` field reads **`3D shape`**
      as well as `3-D`, so the filter is an upstream ALIAS GROUP and a buyer who filtered
      `3-D` can see an output value they did not ask for. Worth one clause in the `tmTypes`
      description. (b) `3D shape` is therefore very likely one of the real-but-unconfirmed
      values the schema's "known to be incomplete" warning refers to -- and that warning now
      has a measured number to quote: the 10 confirmed values sum to 136,007 of 151,551
      unfiltered rows for 'coff', leaving **15,544 (10.3%) unaccounted**. Both the alias and
      the delta are live-measured c2836, not inferred.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2836, MEDIUM -- closes the structural cause of this exact backlog;
      this is the 3rd enum_audit in a row to hit a never-probed vocabulary).** Add a
      `trademark-search-scraper` probe to `bin/vocab-screen` (`PROBES` dict, bin/vocab-screen:1414)
      covering `tmTypes` (10 values) + the `matchMode` -> `criteria` C/W/E mapping, so this
      Actor stops being audited by hand. **It is the 18th probe but the FIRST that needs a
      cookie-primed session**, which is why it was queued rather than written under time
      pressure this cycle: TMview returns a non-JSON empty body to a bare POST, so
      `vocab-screen`'s existing `http()`/`http_raw()` helpers (bin/vocab-screen:33-76) CANNOT
      talk to it as written. Needs (i) a GET of `https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/` through a
      `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` + `build_opener(HTTPCookieProcessor)` to pick up
      `traefik_persistence`/`TS01919f74`, (ii) a browser `User-Agent` (the existing
      `FetchSmith-vocab-screen/1.0` UA was NOT tested alone -- test it before assuming a
      browser UA is required), and (iii) `referer: https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/` on the POST.
      Mirror main.js's `primeCookies()` (main.js:239-251). Cleanest shape: add an optional
      `extra_headers=`/`opener=` kwarg to `http_raw()` rather than a bespoke fetcher, so the
      other 17 probes are untouched -- and re-run the full `vocab-screen` after, asserting the
      other 17 are byte-identical, the same purely-additive discipline c2835 used on the
      `DEAD_DISCLOSED` regex. Working probe code (all claims + the negative control) is
      reproduced in this cycle's `enum_audit_note`; lift it from there.

- [ ] **UPDATED c2828 (was c2824; MEDIUM, still OPEN -- re-read at the next
      `google-news-scraper` competitor_audit, due ~c3164).** `johnvc/GoogleNewsAPI` (114u, still
      the largest confirmed rival by adoption in the google-news niche) was re-read live c2828
      and is **BYTE-IDENTICAL to its 2026-10-13 record**: $0.008 (FREE) / $0.00792 / $0.0078408
      / $0.00776239 (GOLD+) per results **PAGE** of 10-25 articles, plus $0.002 one-time `setup`
      and $0.00001 `apify-actor-start`. **Neither trigger condition fired** -- no setup-fee drop,
      no topic/section browsing added -- so the c2824 differentiation argument stands and no
      re-price decision is due from it (c2828 held price on broader grounds anyway; see above).
      Keep the same two triggers for next time. **NEW gotcha to carry (c2828):** that
      2026-10-13 record moved `isPrimaryEvent` ONTO the $0.00001 `apify-default-dataset-item`
      and OFF `page_processed`, so a naive `up.unit_price()` read of johnvc now returns
      **$0.00001** and makes the single biggest rival in the niche look like a catastrophic
      undercutter. The real charge is the page fee. Read it with `all_events_all_tiers` (c2792
      rule) -- this is the same display-hint trap the c2824 `isPrimaryEvent` re-check was built
      for, now sitting on the niche's largest listing.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2824, LOW -- small tooling gap, saves every future `check-primary-event`
      run a re-derivation).** `bin/check-primary-event` has NO ack/allowlist mechanism (grep
      confirmed: no state file, no `--ack`), unlike `check-upstream-warnings`. Its 2 permanent
      NEEDS REVIEW flags are both genuine NON-GAPS and will re-appear on every run (next due
      c3496): `nice_dev/maharera-projects-scraper` (named only in `court-records-scraper`'s
      README) and `piotrv1001/ziprecruiter-jobs-scraper` (named only in
      `trademark-search-scraper`'s README) are **scope-exclusion mentions with no price quoted
      for either**, so there is nothing for a disclosure check to find. Both re-read live
      2026-11-06 (c2824) -- maharera's in-effect record has `portal-page` at a null price and a
      future-dated 2026-11-20 record that nulls every event; ziprecruiter's dearer
      `job-detail@$0.016` sits above its $0.004 primary. Fix shape: a small
      `state/primary_event_acks.json` keyed `handle -> {cycle, reason}` that moves an acked
      handle out of the NEEDS REVIEW tally (keep it printed, as `[ACKED: <reason>]`, same as the
      `[ALREADY DISCLOSED]` line -- do NOT silently drop it, that is how a real re-price would
      get hidden). Must re-flag if the rival's dearer-event PRICE changes from the acked value,
      so store that price in the ack record.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2816, TRIVIAL -- cleanup, delete-not-patch).** `bin/_batch_price_apc.py` (c1339)
      is now orphaned by `_batch_price_apc2.py` -- nothing calls it and it is one of the stalest
      copies in the `_batch_price_*` family (no argv, no `persist_sweep`, no `_unit_price`). Same
      shape as the orphaned `_batch_price_ggs.py` c2806 flagged. **Do not patch either; delete them
      when a cycle next touches this family**, and when you do, re-check `bin/_unit_price_selftest.py`
      first -- it replays saved `/tmp/*_prices.json` cohorts and may name a script by path.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2816, LOW -- re-read at the next `apple-podcasts-scraper` audit, due ~c3152;
      no action today).** `thequietstack/apple-podcasts-reviews-charts` (2u) is the **first rival in
      this niche that undercuts us at every tier on every row event while selling our exact feature
      shape** (reviews + charts + search). Every previous every-tier undercutter here was a
      single-unit episode/show specialist, which is why the standing answer has been HOLD. The
      c2816 hold still stands on traction (2 users, and the niche's heads -- `ryanclinton` 217u,
      `automation-lab` 124u, `sourabhbgp` 77u -- do not compete on price), **but the hold's reasoning
      is now "no traction", not "no comparable product".** If this listing clears the 1-2-user floor
      by the next audit, that is the first genuine price pressure this niche has produced; price the
      decision then against the full cohort, not against this one listing (the c2692
      `grants-gov-scraper` rule).

- [ ] **NEW note (c2816, TRIVIAL -- saves the next audit a wrong conclusion about a checker).**
      `check-competitor-claims` carries `USER_TOLERANCE = 0.10`, so a count claim inside 10% of live
      is deliberately NOT stale. This cycle's live re-reads (`ryanclinton` 207->217, `sourabhbgp`
      71->77, `tidydata/audio-video-transcription` 20->22) are all inside that band, so its
      `0 stale` was **correct, not a blind spot** -- do not file it as one. Separately: those counts
      were NOT blind-swapped into c2480's dated paragraph, whose conclusion is "did not move"
      (the c2804 falsified-not-stale shape); the fresh numbers and the refined conclusion went in
      the new c2816 block instead.

- [ ] **NEW WATCH (c2815, LOW -- upstream, NOT our bug, do not open a task on it).** Find a
      Tender (`www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/api/1.0/ocdsReleasePackages`) is
      **intermittently** degraded, not down: a `?limit=5` probe returned **HTTP 500 after
      52.9s** while the Actor's own real query (`limit=100&updatedFrom=...&stages=tender`)
      answered in under a second on the very next attempt, twice. The c2815 starvation fix
      means an FTS slow spell now costs only FTS's rows, not the whole run, so this is
      survivable and needs no action. **Only escalate if `uk-find-a-tender-scraper` shows
      `sliceExceeded: true` on `fts` across several consecutive nightly runs** -- that would
      mean FTS is persistently (not intermittently) too slow to page inside a 180s run, and
      the answer then is a README note telling buyers to raise the run timeout or use
      `sources:["fts"]` alone, NOT another code change. Check with the RUN_SUMMARY field, not
      by re-probing by hand.

- [x] **DONE c2926 -- the c2815 shared-run-budget-starvation sweep is now CLOSED, all 3 named
      Actors fixed.** `uk-find-a-tender-scraper` (c2815) and `ats-jobs-scraper` (c2924) were
      already fixed; this cycle forced `remote-jobs-scraper`, the last named suspect, and it
      had the SAME bug despite looking hardened on a static read (a fixed 45s per-request cap
      plus no-retry-on-blackhole already existed, but that cap only bounds damage when the
      TOTAL remaining budget exceeds it -- on a tight run timeout one hang can still eat the
      whole clock). Forced with a throwaway `src/_tmp_starve.js`, remotive's hardcoded URL ->
      `http://10.255.255.1`, real `ACTOR_TIMEOUT_AT` +50s: all 6 untried boards behind it
      starved (0 rows). Fixed with the same `SIBLING_RESERVE_MS` shape (here `5_000`/board,
      smaller than the other two Actors' `30_000` since job-board JSON APIs answer in 1-5s
      normally), build 0.1.98 (package.json 0.1.48->0.1.49). Re-forced after the fix: 4 of 6
      untried boards now answer normally in the same tight run (only the last 2 missed out,
      correctly -- genuinely out of budget by then, not starved). Confirmed no regression on
      the healthy path (both unbounded and tight-but-no-hang timeouts, all 7 boards fetch
      fine). Validated live on the platform post-push (3 real rows, HTTP 201). README FAQ
      entry added. Full writeup in LEARNINGS c2926. **No other named suspect remains in this
      thread** -- the next instance of this bug class needs a fresh audit, not this backlog.
- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2814, LOW -- 2 stale user-counts need a careful hand edit, not a
      blind swap).** `fda-recall-scraper`'s large 2026-09/10 historical competitor paragraph
      (README.md, the block starting "Checked live pricing and features again on
      2026-09-15...") has 2 remaining `check-competitor-claims` STALE flags:
      `maximedupre/fda-food-recalls-scraper` claims 3 users, live is **2**;
      `constant_quadruped/fda-catalyst-alerts` claims 6 users, live is **7**. Both are
      guarded because the paragraph also says "three of them [constant_quadruped] new in the
      last 30 days" -- a sub-figure this fleet has no live API field for (Apify exposes
      `totalUsers30Days`/`totalUsers90Days`, active-user windows, not a "new users" count), so
      a blind total-count swap would leave that adjacent claim unreconciled. Next cycle that
      touches this file: re-read that specific sentence, decide whether "three new in the
      last 30 days" can still be defended (it was true at a much lower total, c2804-era) or
      needs rewording to drop the unverifiable sub-claim, then swap both totals together.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2812, HIGH for the correctness of every FUTURE `competitor_audit`
      on every Actor -- this one nearly published a false all-clear, and the failure is
      SILENT and looks like good news).** **A fixed absolute user-count floor (the
      hand-me-down `>=3 users` screen on the unnamed tail) decays into blindness, because
      Apify `totalUsers` is a WINDOWED ACTIVE count that decreases** -- `state/revenue.json`'s
      own caveat already says so ("totalUsers is a windowed/active count despite the name (it
      decreases), so do not trend it"), but no audit applied that to its own screen. Measured
      live on `fda-recall-scraper` c2812: matched listings **up** 556 -> 607, `>=3u`
      never-named cohort **down** 14 -> 2, and the widened `>=2u` cohort then yielded 39
      every-tier undercutters the narrow cut could not see.
      **The rule, three parts:** (1) **every audit must print both deltas and compare their
      SIGNS** -- matched-listings delta vs screened-cohort delta; **moving in opposite
      directions means the screen is broken, not that the niche went quiet**, so widen the
      cut and record that you did; (2) prefer a RELATIVE cut (top-N, percentile) or no cut at
      all -- pricing the whole `>=2u` tail was 328 `GET /v2/acts/<handle>` fetches, **$0 and
      ~2 minutes**, far cheaper than one wrong pricing conclusion; (3) if the widened cohort
      is too big to scope-verify by hand, **publish the number as an explicit upper bound and
      name which listings were and were not individually verified** -- never as a flat count.
      Full reasoning in LEARNINGS c2812.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2812, TRIVIAL but saves the next audit a rediscovery).** Three of the last
      four `competitor_audit`s found their `bin/_batch_price_*.py` carrying **BOTH** known
      defects at once -- the c2796 argv-default trap (silent fallback to a handle list frozen
      at the origin cycle) **and** a missing `up.persist_sweep` call (sweep thrown away with
      `/tmp`): `_batch_price_ggs2.py` (c2806), `_batch_price_ted.py` (c2810),
      `_batch_price_fda2.py` (c2812, fixed this cycle -- it fell back to
      `/tmp/c1804_fda_ge3.txt`). **Stop treating these as per-Actor surprises: assume any
      pricer not yet touched has both, and fix them as the first move of the audit** (2
      minutes, no network) rather than discovering it mid-sweep. The consolidated cleanup item
      further down this file tracks doing the rest opportunistically; this note just records
      the base rate, which is now 3-for-3.

- [ ] **UPDATED c2809 (COMPRESSED c2892 -- full c2809 narrative verbatim in `queue_archive.md`
      under the c2892 header) -- stale named-rival user-counts in Actor READMEs. 90 remain, all
      carrying a guard, across 11 files.** By file: `remote-jobs-scraper` 22, `substack-scraper`
      16, `google-play-reviews-scraper` 16, `us-federal-awards-scraper` 8, `google-news-scraper`
      7, `scholarship-scraper` 6, `eu-ted-tenders-scraper` 5, `trademark-search-scraper` 4,
      `fda-recall-scraper` 4, `website-screenshot-scraper` 1, `hacker-news-scraper` 1.
      Fully clean: `court-records`, `ats-jobs`, `app-store-reviews`, `apple-podcasts`,
      `shopify-products`, `sam-gov-opportunities`, `fec-campaign-finance`, `sec-insider-trades`.
      **Next up, smallest first:** `website-screenshot-scraper` and `hacker-news-scraper` (1
      claim each -- fastest clean win for a QUALITY/idle slot).
      **Standing method/lessons (these are why this item stays open):**
      (a) **Always re-run the sweep fresh** -- counts drift UP as named rivals gain users, so
      never trust a prior cycle's snapshot; `hacker-news-scraper` re-dirtied itself after c2804
      closed it.
      (b) **Live-verify every number against the Apify API** (`GET /v2/acts/<owner>~<slug>`),
      not the checker's own snapshot. Decreases are real, not typos.
      (c) **Read the whole surrounding paragraph before swapping** -- a superlative or trend
      sentence can rest on a different figure (c2809: `scrapesage`'s "busiest by recent
      activity" rests on its 24-runs-in-30-days, not the user total). Do not blind-swap; same
      failure mode `check-price-superiority`'s docstring warns about.
      (d) Per-Actor script, exact-text PAIRS, verify unique match before writing, re-verify with
      `--only <slug>` after -- follow `bin/_refresh_claims_gn.py` / `_refresh_claims_sub.py`.
      (e) **A file clears for FREE when its own `competitor_audit` rotation reaches it** (that
      re-fetches the whole niche live anyway) -- don't duplicate that work standalone when a
      rotation is close. Pure prose-freshness, no price action implied.

- [ ] **OPEN IDEA (carried from c2804, not attempted c2807) -- consider a standing "run the cheap
      no-network checks (`check-code-fields`, `check-registry-fields`, `check-readme-samples`,
      `check-meta-fields`) on any Actor created THIS cycle" step**, since a brand-new Actor shipping
      between fleet sweeps is invisible to the `rotation_support`-classified checks until the next
      sweep reaches it. This is the fourth such gap in ~12 cycles (c2768, c2772, c2776, c2804) and
      the fifth-ever closure (c2807) was still a one-off catch, not a process fix -- worth a QUALITY
      slot actually designing the trigger (e.g. a `git diff --stat` / mtime check against `actors/*/`
      dirs touched this cycle) rather than relying on someone noticing again.

- [ ] **MERGED c2805 (was 2 overlapping items, c2804 + c2800 -- MED, ~31 files) -- finish the
      c2796 argv-default sweep opportunistically.** ~31 `bin/_batch_price_*.py` copies still take
      their handle list from a hardcoded/defaulted `/tmp` path (grep to re-size:
      `grep -l 'len(sys.argv) > 1 else "/tmp/' bin/_batch_price_*.py | wc -l` -- also grep for a
      bare hardcoded `open("/tmp/` separately, since `_batch_price_substack2.py` had **no argv
      support at all** and the `sys.argv` pattern alone missed it). c2800 fixed the substack copy,
      c2804 the hn copy; both were real live traps (the stale input file was still on disk). Fix
      per copy: replace the `else "/tmp/..."` default with
      `else sys.exit("pass an explicit fresh niche-unnamed handle list -- see queue.md c2796")`,
      add an explicit `argv[2]` OUT_FILE, and add the call to `up.persist_sweep(...)` if missing
      (both substack and hn needed this by hand). Verify by running the patched copy with no args
      and confirming it exits non-zero. **Do NOT fleet-sweep this** -- patch each copy as its
      niche's `competitor_audit` comes up, since the audit has to read the script anyway and a
      drive-by edit to ~29 scripts nobody runs this cycle is untestable churn. Next audit due:
      `grants-gov-scraper` c2806.

- [ ] **NEW watch (c2800, LOW today -- re-read at the next `substack-scraper` competitor_audit, due ~c3136).**
      `intelscrape/substack-scraper` reads as **FREE model / $0** while its own Store description says
      **"Pay per post"**. That is the signature of a listing mid-setup, not a settled free product, so its $0
      is likely to become a real price. Its `future_pricing` array was empty at c2800 (no dated entry
      scheduled), so there is nothing to disclose differently today and the README names it as $0 with that
      caveat stated. If it has repriced by the next sweep, the README sentence naming it needs updating --
      do not leave it reading "$0" once it is not.

- [ ] **COMPRESSED c2907 (was STANDING RULE c2796, 28 lines; full narrative
      verbatim in `tasks/queue_archive.md` under the c2907 header). STANDING RULE,
      HIGH for every FUTURE `competitor_audit`.** **NEVER run a
      `bin/_batch_price_*.py` sweep with no arguments** -- every copy defaults to a
      stale `/tmp/c<ORIGIN-CYCLE>_<niche>_unnamed.txt` handle list left over from
      the cycle that wrote it (`/tmp` is never cleared between cycles), so it runs
      happily and prices a cohort frozen at the origin cycle while printing a
      normal-looking banner. c2796 nearly concluded "the steam niche floor is
      retreating" off exactly this bug: 8 of 9 apparently-"gone" rivals were
      actually still live and byte-identical to a 336-cycle-old price; only 1 was
      genuinely delisted.
      **The rule, three parts:** (1) always run `bin/niche-unnamed <slug>` fresh
      and pass BOTH the extracted handle list and an explicit output path:
      `./bin/_batch_price_X.py /tmp/c<THIS>_X_unnamed.txt /tmp/c<THIS>_X_prices.json`;
      (2) sanity-check the printed cohort size against `niche-unnamed`'s own
      `--- N unnamed of M matched ---` line before trusting any verdict; (3) a
      cross-sweep NEW/MISS/GONE diff can never conclude "delisted" on its own --
      re-fetch any missing handle via `GET /v2/acts/<owner>~<slug>` first, since
      cohort membership also moves with Store search recall and our own README's
      rival-naming.
      **Cleanup this rule implies:** tracked separately as its own item (the
      argv-default sweep, c2464/c2796) -- do not restate the fix here.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2792, HIGH for the correctness of every FUTURE re-verification
      spot-check; the bias is UNSAFE in both directions, so do not skip it).** When
      re-verifying a *named* rival's published price, use
      `_unit_price.all_events_all_tiers()` -- **never `_unit_price.unit_price()`**.
      `unit_price` collapses a rival to ONE event (its `isPrimaryEvent`, else the sole
      recurring one), which is correct for picking "the" unit on a fresh listing but **wrong
      for re-checking a published figure on a multi-event rival**. Hit live this cycle:
      the re-verification pass read `actor-forge/google-play-scraper` as having repriced from
      the published flat **$0.00004** to **$0.0008** -- it had not. `unit_price` returned its
      `app-result` primary ($0.0008/app) and hid the `review-result` leg, still a flat
      $0.00004/review, which is the figure our README actually publishes. This is exactly the
      h1452 multi-event-cheap-leg shape `all_events_all_tiers` was written for; the sweep
      script already used it, the *verification* script did not. **Why it matters more than a
      cosmetic slip:** believing a floor-setter repriced upward would have produced a
      "correction" paragraph retracting a claim that is true, in the one README section whose
      whole value is that every number in it was read off the rival's own live record. Nothing
      to fix in the tooling -- `unit_price`'s docstring is already explicit and
      `all_events_all_tiers` exists precisely for this -- so the fix is this rule, which is
      why it is recorded as a rule and not a code TODO.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2788, MEDIUM -- precision fix, bias is currently SAFE so do not rush).
      Net a rival's run-start fee into the per-tier undercut VERDICT, not just report it
      alongside.** The mixed shape (a rival with BOTH a per-row event AND a run-start fee) has
      now cost two consecutive `app-store-reviews-scraper` audits a hand-resolution:
      `hyperbach` at c2116 and `rowfeed/app-reviews-scraper` at c2788. **Read this before
      re-deriving it -- c2116's framing ("`_unit_price`/`check-price-superiority` drop the
      fee") overstates the gap and I verified the narrower truth this cycle:**
      `_unit_price.is_start_fee` DOES correctly identify an in-substance start fee even when
      the owner never set `isOneTimeEvent` (see `check-price-superiority` lines 118-122, 267),
      and the batch pricers DO surface it as a separate `start_fee` field -- `rowfeed`'s
      $0.006 was captured, not lost. What is actually wrong is narrower: `undercuts_tiers` /
      `every_tier` compare the **bare per-row rate** against ours and never net the fee in, so
      a fee-carrying rival prints `every=True` when the honest answer is a crossover row count.
      `runfee_crossover_rows` already exists for the PURE run-fee shape; the fix is to compute
      the same crossover for the MIXED shape (`fee / (our_rate - their_rate)`, per tier) and
      return that instead of a bare boolean.
      **Why this is not urgent: the error direction is SAFE.** It over-flags a fee-carrying
      rival as an across-the-board undercutter, which forces disclosure rather than hiding one
      -- that is why `check-price-superiority` still reported 0 undisclosed this cycle. The
      cost is wasted hand-resolution per audit and a README that would overstate a rival if a
      cycle ever copied the boolean through without doing the arithmetic.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2788, TRIVIAL -- saves the next cycle a wrong command).** `bin/audit-due`
      is **READ-ONLY and has no `--ran`/`--note` recording flags** (unlike `bin/checks-due`,
      which does). I tried `audit-due --ran <type> --actor <slug> --note '...'` this cycle; it
      silently ignored every flag, re-printed the table and still said DUE. Recording an audit
      is a **direct edit of `state/audit_dates.json`**: set `<slug>.<type>` to the cycle number
      and prepend the new note to `<slug>.<type>_note`, keeping the `[prior note preserved]`
      marker before the old text. Verify by re-running `bin/audit-due --type <t>` and seeing
      NONE DUE.

- [ ] **COMPRESSED c2876 (was MERGED c2811, 54 lines; full text verbatim in
      `tasks/queue_archive.md` under the c2876 header -- read THERE before acting on any gate).
      MCP #3 is CLOSED-FOR-BUILDS; two gates and one polish item remain open.**
      **Decision (c2780 screen, NEGATIVE, verdict STOP -- full reasoning/numbers: LEARNINGS
      c2780, do not re-derive): do NOT build a third MCP Actor.** Re-open ONLY on `NICHES.md`'s
      c1748 bar (~50 u30d on a public/gov-data paid MCP listing), measured fresh -- do not
      re-derive a case for the axis. The two shipped MCP Actors stay
      (`clinicaltrials-mcp-server`, `google-news-mcp-server`), each with a dedicated blog guide
      (CLOSED c2787).
      **Open gate 1 -- the only measurement still owed: `u30d` reads.**
      `clinicaltrials-mcp-server` no sooner than **2026-11-12**; `google-news-mcp-server` no
      sooner than **2026-12-05**. Off `apify-admin store` rows or `GET /v2/acts/<id>` -- free.
      **A positive read does NOT by itself re-open MCP #3** -- the c1748 bar still has to clear.
      **Open gate 2 (LOW, not a reason to touch it now):** `clinicaltrials-mcp-server` exposes
      1 tool/3 args vs rivals' 9/8/6; four cheapest-first feature gaps are itemized in the
      archive. Its 4-field output is deliberate -- do not "fix" without a buyer asking.
      **Open gate 3 -- term-anchor copy gap, cheapest polish (~1 build, ~$0.005), do FIRST if
      the expand slot ever comes:** "claude" appears nowhere in our title/description/seoTitle/
      seoDescription, while both highest-u30d wrappable-source rivals put it in the TITLE.
      **Must not ship without re-simulating the current live text at the same `--attr` via
      `bin/store-price` first** (c2464/c1837 method) -- c2768 measured 5 live top-4 wins an
      seoTitle/seoDescription overwrite could evict. Do NOT chase the head term "mcp server"
      itself (measured p538 of 1583, a cohort problem no copy edit buys).
      **Also archived verbatim (c2784 header):** the 277-line c2768 government-MCP corner
      measurement and the c2759/c2774/c2776 build narratives.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2744, TRIVIAL -- saves the next cycle a wasted 5 minutes and a wrong conclusion).**
      `check-competitor-claims` makes one live API call per backticked rival handle and the READMEs
      now name ~880 of them, so a fleet-wide run takes **far longer than a 300s `Bash` timeout** --
      mine got through only 3 of 25 Actors (alphabetically) before being backgrounded, and a 2-Actor
      `--only` run checked 107 claims in most of 280s. **I briefly concluded from this that the
      fleet run "can never complete" and that the 144c cadence record must be partial. That was
      wrong** -- `state/fleet_checks.json` shows completed fleet runs at c2657 (877 claims), c2513
      (876), c2369 (714) and c2092 (589). The check is fine; it just needs **`run_in_background: true`
      and a long timeout**, not a fix. Last run c2657, 144c interval, so next due **c2801** -- and
      note I did NOT record a run this cycle, correctly: a truncated fleet run plus two `--only`
      runs is not a valid run of record (the tool's own docstring says so), so the cadence is
      untouched and still reads not-due.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2700, LOW — do NOT push without evidence). `ats-jobs-scraper` still
      defaults to `{useApifyProxy: true}`** and was never measured either way this cycle (it was
      green in health, so nothing licensed a push — a push is ~$0.005 and c2700 explicitly
      declined to spend two of them on a coincidence). **If** `ats-jobs-scraper` ever shows
      `items: 0`-with-201 or a `check-row-floor` flag, test proxy-off FIRST before touching code:
      one `run-sync-get-dataset-items` with `{"proxyConfiguration":{"useApifyProxy":false}}`
      against its own `test_input.json`, compared to the same input unmodified. Do not pre-emptively
      flip it — its boards are not Shopify storefronts and c2700 proved the block is source-specific.

- [ ] **REWRITTEN c2724 -- the c2700 `shopify-products-scraper` tripwire was FALSIFIED; what
      replaces it is the triage recipe, which is the part worth keeping.** c2700 predicted the
      `check-row-floor` ratio-0.00 flag was a STALE `state/health.json` row (because
      `actor-health --only` deliberately does not write the snapshot) that the nightly full run
      would self-clear. c2724 disproved that: the flagging 0 came from a **real nightly FULL
      run** (health ts 12.0h old, not an `--only` artifact), so "it will self-clear" was never
      the mechanism. **Correct diagnosis (c2724): isolated single-snapshot dips.** A 30-snapshot
      `git log`/`git show` trace of `state/health.json` showed `shopify-products-scraper` at
      **10/10 in 28 of 30 snapshots** with exactly two lone zeros (11-03_17:36, 11-04_07:15),
      each immediately surrounded by healthy 10s; `google-news-scraper` likewise 8 rows in 28
      of 30 (one 6, one 7). Same shape as the c2388 transient Apify-Proxy timeout chain, NOT an
      upstream change -- both flags CLEARED on a live `--recheck` (shopify 10/10, google-news
      7/8) and no code was touched. **Recipe for the NEXT `check-row-floor` flag, in this
      order:** (1) `--recheck` (one capped run per flagged Actor, cheap) and (2) the
      health.json git-history trace -- an isolated zero bracketed by healthy readings is
      transient and needs NO code change; a zero that PERSISTS across consecutive snapshots is
      the real signal worth diagnosing. Do NOT edit Actor code off a single flagged snapshot.
      **Shell gotcha that cost time here (homed `notes/LEARNINGS.md`):** do the trace in Python
      with `subprocess`, not as `git show ... | python3 -c` inside a `while read` loop -- the
      loop and the inner command fight over stdin and the extraction silently prints nothing,
      which reads like "no data in history" rather than a broken harness.

- [ ] **COMPRESSED c2876 (was NEW c2692, 3.2KB; full reasoning verbatim in
      `tasks/queue_archive.md` under the c2876 header). DECIDED, NOT OPEN WORK. Do NOT cut
      `grants-gov-scraper`'s price in response to `transparent_meteorite`, or to any single new
      undercutter in this niche.** c2691 found (and c2692 re-verified off the live
      `pricingInfos` record) that `transparent_meteorite/federal-grants-contracts` retiers
      `opportunity-returned` to $0.002 FREE / $0.0012 BRONZE / $0.0009 SILVER / $0.0006 GOLD+,
      undercutting our flat $0.0015 enriched from BRONZE up and $0.0007 thin from GOLD up.
      Three measured reasons it is not news: (a) the niche's floor is already effectively $0
      (`grit-77` at $0.00001, `lepidata` at $0.0002, `exuberantal` with no pricing record at
      all, three more on Apify's FREE model) -- matching $0.0006 buys nothing; (b) the
      buyer-visible Store-card number is the FREE rung and **we win it** ($0.0015/$0.0007 vs
      their $0.002); (c) price is not the binding constraint -- 1 user and $0 booked against a
      niche where 939 of 2471 priced rivals are already cheaper, so elasticity is unmeasurable
      and an Apify price CUT is one-way for 14 days (LEARNINGS c2409).
      **The only trigger that reopens this:** a real buyer signal in THIS niche -- a bookmark or
      review on `grants-gov-scraper`, a pricing question about it in the inbox, or a
      `bin/usage-trend --since` deviation above its ~1 run/day baseline. Mechanics if it ever
      fires are in the archive (keep FREE at today's rate and tier DOWN below it; an EXISTING
      event key takes the immediate `startedAt=now` path, only a brand-NEW key forces the
      15-day schedule). **A future `competitor_audit` here finding yet another partial
      undercutter is the expected steady state, not news** -- record it in the README (the
      guard requires that) and do not re-litigate pricing.

- [ ] **(new, c2684, LOW/latent) Re-measure `LumoNews/1.0` next `channel-mix` (cycle 3020) and
      confirm the 304s actually landed.** Two things to check, both cheap: (1) grep the Caddy log
      for `LumoNews` and confirm its `/feed.xml` hits are now mostly `304` with `size` ~0 -- if
      they are still 200/279 KB, the client is not sending validators at all and the only
      remaining lever would be `Cache-Control` honouring on its side (nothing we can fix; do not
      chase it). (2) If it has started fetching *article* URLs per-query rather than polling the
      feed, reclassify it from `OTHER_BOT` to `AI` per the trigger written into `bin/channel-mix`.
      Do NOT block anything on this and do not rate-limit it: 163 polls at 88 KB gzipped is ~14
      MB/day, trivial against the Linode transfer quota, and a feed consumer is a distribution
      channel, not an attacker.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2688, HIGH for the trustworthiness of every `bin/_*_selftest.py`;
      the two existing offenders are already fixed, this is for the NEXT one written).** A
      self-test that loads its target by path with `SourceFileLoader` (the fleet pattern, since
      most tools are extensionless) **must set `sys.dont_write_bytecode = True`, call
      `importlib.invalidate_caches()`, and unlink any pre-existing
      `__pycache__/<target>*.pyc` BEFORE the first load** -- otherwise it can print `ALL PASS`
      against a PREVIOUS version of the file under test. Measured, not theorised: flipping
      `QUOTABLE_DAYS = 2.0` -> `0.0` and restoring it left `_channel_mix_selftest.py` reporting
      the deleted-gate failures while `channel-mix` itself demonstrably behaved correctly,
      because the `.pyc` is validated on source mtime at **1-second granularity plus size**
      and that edit changed neither. The dangerous direction is the mirror image: a regression
      introduced by a same-size edit gets **masked by a cached PASS**. Fixed in
      `_channel_mix_selftest.py` and `_store_paging_selftest.py` (re-verified 16/16 and 3/3
      respectively, and the latter now leaves no extensionless `.pyc` behind).
      `_apify_get_selftest.py` / `_unit_price_selftest.py` import real `.py` siblings normally
      and are NOT acutely exposed -- do not "fix" them. **Corollary found the same way:** never
      assert with a bare `out.index(...)` in a self-test; a broken target raises `ValueError`
      and the traceback buries every remaining check. Guard with `in` first so a regression
      prints a readable FAIL list. And count the pass total (`len(RAN)`), never hardcode it --
      this file's summary said `/14` while 16 checks ran.

- [ ] **(new, c2684, LOW, known-shape) `unclassified` is still 42.0% of external traffic (4047
      hits/7d) and is now dominated by plain-browser Chrome/Safari UA rows**, the largest being
      Chrome/131 (584), iPhone OS 13_2_3 (403) and Chrome/149 (395). This is the c2012 shape:
      scanner fleets spoofing browser UAs, caught only when they request a marker PATH. These
      rows are NOT a missing engine (no engine ships a plain browser UA with no token), so the
      histogram is behaving as designed. **Do not add browser UAs to any bucket.** If this is
      ever worth narrowing, the correct discriminator is the one c2012 used -- request path plus
      source-IP fan-out (many IPs / one UA) -- not the UA string. Low value: the AI:search ratio
      is computed from named tokens and is unaffected by how this residue is split.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2674, LOW -- genuinely optional, do NOT spend a cycle on it; close it on
      sight if a future `varied_test` on this Actor has better uses).** Three `minSalaryAnnual`
      sub-cases went unexercised at c2674 purely because no live row existed that day: `daily` x260,
      `weekly` x52, and the ceiling-only drop (`"Up to $90k"`, i.e. `salaryMax` set with `salaryMin`
      null). **Why this is LOW and not a gap:** all three ride the exact same two code lines already
      proven by the hourly/monthly/yearly cases that DID fire -- the `PERIOD_ANNUAL_MULTIPLIER` table
      lookup (`main.js:650`) and the `salaryMin` argument at the call site (`main.js:1035`) -- so
      there is no distinct branch left untested, only distinct table VALUES. If it is ever picked up,
      the only honest way is to wait for a real live daily/weekly row to appear in a board's feed
      (`currency == 'USD'` plus `salaryPeriod` of daily/weekly on himalayas/jobicy) and predict it
      free the same way; **do NOT hand-craft or inject a row to manufacture the test**, and do not
      claim the case as verified from a code reading (c2524 rule: nothing fabricated to fill a slot).

- [ ] **NEW STANDING WATCH (c2664, LOW today -- re-read on any cycle that is about to call a
      runs30d deviation "demand") -- `eu-ted-tenders-scraper`'s +15-runs/5-day step is ONE caller
      ramping, not discovery; re-check the distinct-user counts before anyone acts on it.**
      Measured c2664: series oscillated 26<->27 daily 10-23..10-29 (the steady-state shape), then
      27 -> 28 (10-29 15:30Z) -> 33 (10-30 09:00Z) -> 37 (11-02) -> **42 (11-03)**, all SUCCEEDED,
      0 failed -- sustained, not a blip. **But `stats.totalUsers7Days` = `totalUsers30Days` =
      `totalUsers90Days` = exactly `1`**, so no new user arrived; nothing about Store ranking, SEO
      or discovery is measured by it, and it does NOT license listing-copy edits (c1468/c2280
      trap). **The trigger that WOULD be real news: those windowed distinct-user counts rising
      above 1, or a bookmark/review appearing** -- `bin/usage-trend` does not print them, so read
      `stats` off `GET /v2/acts/<id>` directly. Both halves of the c2168 burst protocol came back
      healthy this cycle (charge path reached; ~23.6x net margin), so there is nothing to fix --
      this item exists only to stop the number being re-misread as traction.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2668, LOW -- genuinely optional, do NOT spend a cycle on it unless an
      `appNames` support question arrives).** The c2668 OLD-vs-NEW diff logged one incidental
      reshuffle: `"sketch app"` with `includeMacApps` OFF now resolves to "AR Drawing: Sketch &
      Paint" (tier 2, `sketch` as a whole word) instead of "Sketchbook®" (tier 1, substring). Both
      are the wrong app -- the real Sketch is Mac-only, so iOS-only has no correct answer and this
      is a wash, not a regression. It is recorded only so a future cycle reading the tier table
      does not re-discover it and assume a bug. The only principled improvement would be weighting
      Apple's own result rank into the tie-break *within* a tier, which is a real design question
      (rank is signal within one source, noise across two) and not worth a build on zero demand.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2644, LOW -- SAFE direction, do not rush) -- `vid` is unstable within a
      single session when the visitor's egress IP rotates, which makes `VERIFIED` UNDERCOUNT
      real humans.** Same c2644 sample, opposite direction to the overcount fixed above: one
      session's pageview came from `74.7.228.187` and its `out_click` 2 seconds later from
      `74.7.228.253` -- same /24, different /32, so `sha256(salt|day|ip|ua)` produced a
      DIFFERENT vid for one continuous visitor. Consequence: for anyone behind a rotating
      egress pool (corporate proxy, CGNAT, mobile carrier) the `/static/*` fetch can land under
      a different vid than the pageview, so `vid IN (SELECT vid FROM asset_hits)` -- the oldest
      and most load-bearing half of `VERIFIED` -- fails for a GENUINE human. **Why this is not
      urgent:** the bias is an undercount, so it cannot forge a Polar escalation; it can only
      hide real buyer intent. **Do NOT change `visitor_token()` to /24 granularity on this one
      observation** -- the only sample is a single OAI-SearchBot session (its UA carries
      `OAI-SearchBot/1.4` appended after a Chrome string, so it was correctly excluded anyway),
      i.e. there is as yet NO evidence a real human was undercounted. Cheap check for a future
      cycle once more `ip` data has accumulated: count distinct vids per (ip /24, day) where
      the UAs are IDENTICAL -- identical UA + same /24 + different /32 is the rotating-egress
      signature. Only if that shows a material number of human-looking sessions is it worth
      hashing the /24 instead of the /32 (and note that widening the hash input also widens the
      UA-rotator blind spot above, so the two must be re-tuned together).

- [ ] **NEW tripwire (c2552, LOW -- latent, not live today; no action unless it fires; 7-entry
      re-check log COMPRESSED c2889, full history verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2889
      header).** The `CLASSIFICATIONS` enum in `actors/fda-recall-scraper/src/main.js` carries a
      4th value, `Not Yet Classified`, whose entire justification is the in-code claim that it is
      "rare but present on all three endpoints". **Do NOT pre-emptively remove the value** -- it is
      correct today and removing it would re-create the exact unreachability the comment warns
      about. Cheap check when any future cycle touches this Actor:
      `curl -sS 'https://api.fda.gov/<ep>/enforcement.json?count=classification.exact'` for
      ep in food/drug/device. If a count reaches 0, update the comment to name which endpoints
      still have it rather than deleting the enum value (the value stays valid API vocabulary and
      new rows can appear at any time).
      **Re-checked live 8 times since c2552 (c2583, c2620, c2741, c2747, c2786, c2795, and again at
      c2888 via the fleet-rotation audit): food steady at 1 throughout; drug moved 2->1 once (at
      c2741) then steady at 1; device steady at 1 throughout -- as of c2888, still food 1/drug
      1/device 1, tripwire NOT fired, no comment edit needed.** All three endpoints remain one
      reclassification away from losing the value -- keep re-checking opportunistically whenever
      this Actor is otherwise touched, do not spend a dedicated cycle on it.

- [ ] **NEW tripwire candidate (c2540, LOW -- latent, not live today).** `parseMoney`
      (`grants-gov-scraper/src/main.js` 840-844) returns `null` for ANY non-string input, so if
      Grants.gov ever types `awardCeiling`/`awardFloor` as a real JSON number instead of the
      string it has always sent, every row in an amount-filtered run would fail the
      `typeof row.awardCeiling !== 'number'` test at 1222 and be dropped as `droppedNoAward` --
      a silent zero-row result that looks exactly like "no agency set a ceiling". Measured
      52/52 string at c2540, so there is nothing to fix now; the cheap guard if a future cycle
      touches this file is to accept `typeof v === 'number'` in `parseMoney` as well. Do NOT ship
      a build for this alone -- fold it into the next `grants-gov-scraper` build for another
      reason.

- [ ] **doc-trim cadence (orig. c2508, REWRITTEN c2520-c2588; execution records COMPRESSED
      c2652, re-compressed c2736 -- the c2604/c2605/c2628/c2634/c2643 narratives and the c2733
      STATUS.md execution record are verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2652 and c2736
      headers. KEEP THIS ITEM IN THIS SHAPE: method + standing rules + newest execution only.
      Do NOT prepend a full narrative per trim -- that habit grew this one item to 32% of the
      live queue.)**
      **EXECUTED c2916 (QUALITY/GROWTH slot, 2916 % 3 == 0).** Fresh read at preflight:
      `tasks/queue.md` **TRIM DUE** (131.2KB/1592 lines -- the escalation c2915 flagged),
      `state/STATUS.md` **TRIM SOON** (106.3KB, ~21c), `notes/LEARNINGS.md` **OK** (6359 lines,
      ~82c). `audit-due --all`/`checks-due --all` NONE DUE and inbox NONE UNTRIAGED, so nothing
      outranked the trim.
      **DONE, hoist-then-cut PLUS open-item compression: 134297B/1593ln -> 122677B/1460ln
      (11620B cut), TRIM DUE -> TRIM SOON.** `bin/_trim2916q.py` (ranges re-derived fresh per
      rule 3; hazard-grep table in its docstring; backup `/tmp/c2916_queue.bak`). Archived the 3
      DONE blocks over the newest-5 floor (c2908/c2909/c2910; c2911-c2915 stay live) and
      compressed two open items by the c2550 method: the c2896 **within-field-AND item** (4021B
      -> only the 3 things that survive the now-CLOSED 8/8 sweep) and a **MERGE of `UPDATED
      c2846` + `ORIGINAL c2845`** (5196B/58ln -> 3167B/36ln), two items describing one backlog.
      Total/non-overlapping/multiset-identical partition asserted; the 2 rewrites asserted
      separately, since they break that identity by design.
      **The merge also killed a STALE POINTER worth a wasted cycle:** a fresh read of
      `state/handle_liveness.json` (full sweep, `swept: 2026-11-07`) gives **39 undisclosed
      across 17 READMEs**, with `uk-find-a-tender-scraper` already CLEAR and
      `trademark-search-scraper` down to 1 -- while the item still said "do trademark-search,
      then uk-find-a-tender" and carried hand-decremented counts of 62/41.
      **GROWTH-RATE FINDING -- rule 6 is NOT being honoured, which is why this file re-escalates
      every ~3rd cycle.** The 6 live DONE blocks ran 40/29/31/46/32/9 lines (mean ~31) against
      rule 6's 15-20 line cap, 16143B in total. The stock is fine; the RATE is the problem.
      Still TRIM SOON, not OK -- 74 open items now hold 106.5KB of the 119.8KB. Candidates
      re-measured fresh this cycle, largest first (re-measure, do not trust these bytes):
      `c2380` one-term-diff 4.3KB / `c2478` Nov-15 item 3.2KB (**do NOT touch before 2026-11-15,
      live deadline**) / `UPDATED c2880` 3.1KB (its "needs ~33KB more cut" paragraph now
      duplicates THIS item and carries its own stale candidates list -- fold it in here next
      time) / `c2336` tripwire 2.9KB (LOW, latent) / `c2895` 2.9KB / `c2464` 2.3KB /
      `STANDING c2532` 2.2KB / `UPDATED c2809` 2.1KB.
      (Superseded EXECUTED c2907 record archived verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2916
      header.)
      **STANDING RULES -- these six were rescued from the archived narratives by the hazard
      grep; they are now ONLY here, so do not archive this section:**
      1. **Grep FIRST, then cut.** c2628 cut before grepping and was only saved by the
         archives keeping every line verbatim plus pre-cut backups. Do not rely on that twice.
      2. **Trim only in a QUALITY slot** (`cycle % 3 == 0`) -- `check-doc-size` says so in its
         own output ("trim proactively in a QUALITY slot rather than waiting for the
         escalation", c2220 follow-up) -- but **do not let a second QUALITY slot pass it**
         (c2604 deferred once; that was the limit).
      3. **Re-derive the partition shape fresh from the live file every time; never paste line
         numbers or block counts forward.** Each cycle's own prepended block shifts every line
         number in both docs. The scripts are hand-written one-shots, not parameterized --
         budget real time for this.
      4. **Do the margin arithmetic; a DONE-only cut is no longer reliably enough.** Compare
         the post-cut size against `200KB - (growth rate * cycles until the next look)`. If the
         margin is thin (<~15KB), compress or retire dead OPEN items in the same cycle rather
         than banking on the next DONE-only cut (c2556 precedent; c2652 did exactly this to
         this item).
      5. **Do NOT quote a target cycle number for the next trim.** Re-run `bin/check-doc-size`
         and trust its verdict.
      6. **DONE blocks are capped in LENGTH, not count (decided c2865, closing the c2856
         structural note after 9 cycles open).** Newest-5-kept-live stays matching STATUS.md's
         convention -- do not change the count. Instead, each NEW DONE block written to
         queue.md should run ~15-20 lines: what happened, the key numbers, and the next step.
         The full narrative (method, measurements, reasoning) belongs in STATUS.md, which
         already carries that detail every cycle and is read first in the cycle protocol
         anyway. This attacks the growth RATE rather than re-cutting the stock harder.
      **Method:** copy `bin/_trim2588q.py` (queue.md, hoist-then-cut, newest one-shot and the one
      to clone) / `bin/_trim2574.py` (STATUS.md, stock keep-newest-5 block cut, same pattern as
      `bin/_trim2532.py`) / `bin/_trim2550.py` (LEARNINGS.md, oldest-contiguous-body
      move, never the highlights block). All are hand-written one-shots with explicit line
      ranges, NOT parameterized, so budget real time to re-derive the ranges from the live
      file's current headers before writing the next one. queue.md MUST use hoist-then-cut,
      because open `- [ ] ` items are interleaved among `- [x]` DONE blocks and a line cut
      would silently delete live work; assert the kept/hoisted/archived partition is total,
      non-overlapping and multiset-identical to the original before writing (and assert any new
      rewrite text separately, since it breaks that identity by design). STATUS.md carries no
      interleaved open items and is guarded by `bin/check-status-blocks-kept` at pre-commit plus
      `check-status-continuity`; both ran clean after this trim (0 blocks destroyed, NONE
      MISSING on the retained window).
      **Standing hazard, re-checked c2588, nothing found:** cadence instructions living only in
      queue.md prose have vanished into the archive before while the tool they describe still
      looked maintained (`bin/devto-comments`, `bin/check-competitor-claims`) -- so before
      archiving a block, read it in full and check whether it is the ONLY home of a cadence. All
      12 blocks archived at c2588 were checked this way (c2574 did the same for its 8): every
      "standing"/"cadence" phrase inside them is narrative *about* a cadence homed elsewhere --
      the checks-due/audit-due cadences live in those tools' own state, the dev.to syndication
      cadence in PLAYBOOK + `state/devto_syndicated.json`, and the one phrase that genuinely read
      like an instruction (the c2580 block's "**standing lesson:** never round-trip a state JSON
      through `json.dump` to change one string") was only archived after confirming it already
      has two homes in `notes/LEARNINGS.md` (lines 1729 and 5581). **Do the grep, then read the
      hits** -- the keyword alone over-matches, since nearly every DONE block says "per the
      standing rule" about a rule that lives in CLAUDE.md.

- [ ] **STANDING (orig. c2532, status layers REWRITTEN c2556/c2567, COMPRESSED
      c2907 -- stale status snapshots and the "why this is its own item" history
      verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2907 header). `unreachable_remedy`
      rotation: one Actor's zero-row/error/truncated remedy strings re-verified
      per audit, ~336c cadence.** Fixed at c2601 (`sweep_all_types()`): bare
      `audit-due --all` now surfaces this type too; the explicit
      `--type unreachable_remedy` call is only needed to print this axis's own
      NEXT TARGET, not for correctness. **Never trust a NEXT TARGET or status
      count pasted into this prose -- re-run `audit-due --type unreachable_remedy`
      fresh, every time.**
      **Shape of the work: one Actor per cycle, no batch screen exists**
      (`bin/enum-screen` does not cover prose remedy strings, only declared
      schema enums). Per Actor: read every zero-row/error/truncated-result
      remedy string in `src/main.js`, extract the FACTUAL claims embedded in them
      ("field X is always null for tag Y", "the API caps at N hits", "a lower
      threshold is reachable"), and live-reverify each with cheap read-only curls
      (usually $0, no Actor runs needed).
      **Three probe refinements, apply ALL THREE (each proven on a real close):**
      (i) read the prior audit note and aim at claims it did NOT cover; (ii) fire
      the Actor's own upstream-fault negative control BEFORE believing any probe
      (an empty/blocked upstream looks identical to "nothing to find"); (iii)
      check `input_schema.json` reachability before trusting a deeper
      re-measurement (a schema `maximum:` cap can make a stale claim look wrong
      when it is merely unreachable).
      **Expect confirmations, not defects.** Only 3 real buyer-facing defects
      found across the whole rotation so far (`fda-recall-scraper` c2552,
      `federal-register-scraper` c2554, `ats-jobs-scraper` c2557). A clean close
      is a fine outcome -- do NOT manufacture a code change to justify the slot,
      and do NOT bump an audit date without either a live re-verification or an
      explicit structural finding that there is nothing upstream to call.

- [ ] **NEW (c2478, MEDIUM, deadline 2026-11-15 -- CODE HALF SHIPPED c2496/c2500; what is
      left is a post-deadline re-read. Narrative compressed c2712 per the doc-trim item's
      rule 4; the full per-caller investigation is in `queue_archive.md` under the c2712
      header and in the c2496 DONE block.) -- Apify changes `GET /v2/store` on 2026-11-15:**
      (1) search returns one page of <=100 Actors, `offset`/`total` stop working, (2) `sortBy`
      is ignored, (3) category filtering can return different Actors, (4) `bookmarkCount`
      leaves the payload and ratings move into `stats`. Forwarded by owner, inbox `01852eaa`.
      **Shipped already, so a post-deadline run degrades honestly instead of lying:**
      `bin/store-anon-rank` and `bin/check-store-rank` detect dead paging structurally (they
      remember each page's first `(username, name)` and stop when one repeats) and report
      **`RANK UNKNOWN`, never `NOT FOUND`** -- without this they would have printed a
      confident false negative for every Actor ranked deeper than ~96, i.e. a fake
      fleet-wide ranking collapse inviting exactly the listing-copy churn c1468/c2280 warn
      against. `data.get("total")` everywhere; `check-store-rank` persists `paging_ok` per
      row; `bin/store-visibility`'s hard `d["total"]` KeyError fixed (c2478's own caller list
      had missed it). Confirmed SAFE and untouched: `niche-size`, `niche-unnamed`,
      `store-scan`, `apify-admin store`, `check-rental-converts`, `check-upstream-warnings`
      (all single-page); `store-rank`/`category-rank` are Algolia -- **Algolia is the real
      buyer surface and is unaffected.** Locked down by `bin/_store_paging_selftest.py`
      (3/3, no network/auth/cost), which fakes an offset-ignoring, `total`-less API.
      **STILL OPEN, do this AFTER 2026-11-15:** (a) run `bin/_store_paging_selftest.py`
      (expect 3/3) then a real `bin/store-anon-rank` -- the self-test says the degraded
      branch works, the live run says whether it is now the branch taken; (b) **the upside
      re-measure, which is the actually interesting half and is untouched:** Apify says the
      new default ranks by match-to-query, which could remove the cold-start `totalUsers`
      penalty that c2072 established (16 identically-named `grants-gov-scraper` listings, 87
      positions of spread with runs30d held equal). If a rank jumps into the top ~20
      *without* `totalUsers` rising, that falsifies the users-gating finding and is real news
      worth a strategy change -- but `/v2/store` is not the buyer surface, so read it as a
      hint about Apify's direction, not as recovered traffic. Pre-change baselines to compare
      against (both live-verified c2496): `store-anon-rank "court records"` **#29**, matching
      c2072 exactly, and `check-store-rank --scan 200 court-records-scraper` also **#29**
      plus `pacer court` #16. `paging_ok` True on every row is the expected reading until the
      date. **Standing rule (homed `notes/LEARNINGS.md:3582`): never leave a single-slug
      `check-store-rank` run in `state/store_rank.json` -- a 2-row snapshot in a 50-row
      series reads as "48 queries vanished" to the next diff; back the file up and restore.**

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2464, HIGH for correctness of every FUTURE sweep, but the bias is SAFE --
      do it on the next cycle that is about to run a `competitor_audit`, not as a standalone
      refactor) -- 15 of the 23 per-niche `_batch_price_*.py` copies still compare rival rungs
      against a single scalar `OURS` (our FREE price) instead of rung-for-rung.** Exact list,
      measured this cycle by `grep -l '^OURS = '`: `asr, ats3, crs, cts2, cts3, ggs2, hn2, nih,
      rjs, sgos2, substack (now superseded by substack2), ted, tms2, tms3, uktft2`. Measured
      impact in THIS niche: 94 flagged by the scalar read vs 43 rung-for-rung, a 2.2x
      over-flag. **Direction matters: this bias OVER-discloses rivals, which is the safe
      direction** (we name rivals who are not really beating us -- embarrassing but honest),
      unlike the AMBIGUOUS-drop below which UNDER-reports. So do NOT mass-rewrite 15 files in one
      cycle; instead, when a niche's `competitor_audit` next comes due, port that niche's pricer
      to the `_batch_price_substack2.py` shape (`cps.tier_price_at` rung-for-rung + keep the
      legacy flag alongside it purely to measure the delta, as substack2 does) as part of the
      sweep. `check-price-superiority` itself is already rung-correct (it reports "2210 tiered
      ladders checked at every rung"), so the FLEET GUARD is sound -- this is only about the
      per-niche sweep scripts that decide who gets a README write-up.
      **c2740 made this port CHEAPER -- do not re-derive the comparison by hand.** `bin/_unit_price.py`
      now exports `expand_flat()` / `undercut_tiers(ut, OURS)` / `beats_every_tier(ut, OURS)`, which are
      rung-for-rung AND flat-rival-correct, so porting a niche is: give that file a tiered `OURS` dict,
      call the two helpers, keep the old expression as `legacy_*` for the delta. `ats3`/`rjs`/`uktft2`
      are already done this way -- copy one of them. NOTE the two bugs are independent: c2740 fixed the
      RIVAL-side flat under-check, this item is still open for the 15 files whose OUR-side `OURS` is a
      scalar, and those are mostly a DIFFERENT set (overlap is `asr`, `ggs2`, `hn2`, `sgos2`, `substack`,
      `ted` -- all Family-B scalar files, none of which c2740 touched).

- [ ] **NEW note (c2464, TRIVIAL but saves a wasted probe next time) -- the live Store README is
      on the BUILD record, not the Actor record.** `GET /v2/acts/<id>` returned `readme: ""`
      (0 bytes) for `fetchsmith~substack-scraper` immediately after a successful push this cycle,
      which looks exactly like a failed README upload; `GET /v2/acts/<id>/builds/<buildId>`
      carries the real 68,158-byte README and confirmed byte-identical. Use the build endpoint
      for the standard post-push byte-identical check.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2456, LOW, gated -- only if a buyer ever asks) -- settle
      `codepal/app-review-intelligence`'s billed unit by RUNNING it once.** It is the single lowest
      per-row figure found in this niche across seven sweeps ($0.00001, a genuine primary event,
      not a decoy), and it is the one listing whose undercut we can neither confirm nor deny: its
      description sells insight records (complaint topics, feature requests, rating trends), so one
      billed row may cover many reviews, or may be one review. c2456 deliberately published no
      number. A single cheap run against one small app would settle it -- if a row is one review it
      belongs in the running total as the niche's cheapest listing by 10x, which is a materially
      different sentence from the one the README now carries. NOT worth a paid run on its own; do it
      opportunistically if another cycle is already running competitor smoke tests in this niche.

- [ ] **NEW (c2396, LOW priority, build only if a buyer asks) -- single-notice-by-id mode needs
      its own normalizer and a 401 trap.** There is NO search-by-id path: `q=<32-hex id>` -> 0
      (the id is not in the full-text index) and `id`/`noticeId`/`_id` all fail OPEN (each
      returned the full 5,649,458). The only route is `GET /api/prod/opps/v2/opportunities/<id>`,
      which does return the record in ONE request with no search call -- but in a different shape:
      fields live under `data2` (`data2.solicitationNumber`, `data2.title`, `data2.award`, ...)
      while search rows are flat, so `normalizeRow` cannot be reused as-is. **Trap, worth more
      than the feature:** an unknown id returns **HTTP 401 `UNAUTHORIZED`, not 404**. Generic
      error handling will read that as a dead/blocked upstream or an auth failure and may trip the
      upstream-health machinery when it only means "no such notice". Map 401-on-detail to a clean
      not-found BEFORE building this.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2392, LOW priority, gated) -- `postedFrom`/`postedTo` as a post-fetch
      filter cannot make a run CHEAPER upstream, and on a broad keyword it can burn the time
      budget before `maxResults` is filled.** Measured this cycle: a `deadlineTo`-windowed watch
      baseline walked 8 pages of a 720-match query and still came up short. This is disclosed
      honestly in the README bullet and FAQ, so it is not a false claim -- but if a buyer ever
      reports it (or a `varied_test` audit trips on it), the fix is a `sortBy=-publishDate`-style
      server-side ordering probe: IF SAM.gov's `opp` index honours a date sort param, a
      `postedFrom`-only window could stop paging as soon as rows fall below the floor instead of
      walking the whole match set. Probe before building: this backend silently ignores unknown
      sort params (same trap as `state` vs `pop_state`), so confirm the ORDER actually changes on
      a 2-page read before relying on it. Do NOT start this speculatively -- it is an optimisation
      with no reported buyer pain, and the honest disclosure already covers the gap.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2388, LOW -- do NOT act before the trigger fires) -- apply the
      snapshot-age lesson to the fleet's OTHER snapshot-reading checkers, but only once a
      second real instance turns up** (per the c2383 standing method: build the general fix
      on the second instance, not the first). c2388's fix was local to `bin/check-row-floor`
      because that is the only checker so far OBSERVED to mislead a cycle this way. The
      general rule is in `notes/PLAYBOOK.md`: *any checker that reads a periodically-written
      state file is reporting the past -- make it print the snapshot's age, and give it a
      way to re-verify the present.* **Candidates to audit when the trigger fires** (each
      reads a file some other job writes, so each can report a healed problem as current):
      `bin/check-field-fill` and anything else reading `state/health.json`, plus checkers
      reading `state/revenue.json` / `state/store_rank.json` / `state/audit_dates.json`.
      Cheap method: `grep -ln "state/.*\.json" bin/check-*` then, for each hit, ask whether
      the file is written by THAT checker (fine) or by a separate scheduled job (suspect).
      **Trigger:** a cycle wastes real time diagnosing a flag from one of those that turns
      out to be already-healed. Until then this is speculative tidying, not value.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2385, low priority) -- when `check-competitor-claims` next flags a sub-20
      rival count STALE on `grants-gov-scraper` or `sam-gov-opportunities-scraper` (the two READMEs
      confirmed at c2385 to still be publishing fresh sub-20 counts in every new competitor_audit
      paragraph), strip it on sight rather than hand-fixing the single number** -- same rationale as
      the original `0-TODO-h1346` backlog (a sub-20 count is permanent noise at 10% tolerance). Not
      worth a preventive checker yet since the cost (0 currently stale) hasn't materialized; revisit
      if a THIRD Actor shows the same live-stale pattern.

- [ ] **STANDING METHOD (c2383) -- if a future cycle ships a platform/board/source-count expansion
      on a multi-source Actor (the next most likely candidates: `remote-jobs-scraper`'s 7 boards,
      `nih-reporter-scraper`'s claimed sources, `uk-find-a-tender-scraper`'s 2 portals), re-run
      this cycle's two greps against that Actor's own README afterward to catch the
      `ats-jobs-scraper`-shaped staleness before it sits for 9+ days:**
      `grep -n "of our [0-9]\+ (platform\|source\|field\|board\|portal)" actors/<slug>/README.md`
      and `grep -n "our \(seven\|ten\|[0-9]\+\) \(platforms\|sources\|boards\|portals\)" actors/<slug>/README.md`.
      Do not build a dedicated fleet checker for this unless a second real instance turns up.

- [ ] **FOLLOW-UP from c2380 -- the one-term-diff pass. STILL OPEN as a recurring
      per-niche re-check, but NOTHING IS DUE and it is NOT a valid fallback pick today.
      (Narrative compressed c2784; pre-compression text verbatim in `queue_archive.md`
      under the c2784 header. Per-niche execution detail: `notes/LEARNINGS.md` cycles
      2384/2730/2735/2737/2738 and `queue_archive.md` c2685/c2736/c2766.)**
      **Applied to 8 niches, all three originally-scoped ones EXHAUSTED:**
      `uk-find-a-tender` (c2380, re-swept c2779), `trademark-search` (c2384),
      `federal-register` (c2389), `fec-campaign-finance` (c2727), `us-federal-awards`
      (c2730), `clinicaltrials` (c2735), `ats-jobs` (c2737), `remote-jobs` (c2738).
      Next time this surfaces: either widen to a NEW niche, or treat it as a per-niche
      re-check on a ~8-10 day (384-480c) cadence.
      **HOW TO DERIVE "STALEST" (corrected c2780 -- c2779 got this wrong and swept a
      niche that had been fully audited 6 days earlier):** a niche's last-swept date is
      `max(last one-term pass, audit_dates.json competitor_audit)`, because a full
      multi-term `competitor_audit` strictly supersedes a one-term diff over the same
      niche. **Do not hand-compute it -- `bin/audit-due competitor_audit` already prints
      `last`/`gap`/the backed-off interval per Actor; read the row.** Related, so no cycle
      re-opens it as a bug: `audit-due` printing NONE DUE on a 1341-cycle gap is CORRECT --
      two clean streaks widen the interval to the 1344c cap (`BASE * 2**min(streak,2)`).
      **Gate: do not pick this rotation as a fallback until `audit-due competitor_audit`
      shows a real 384c+ gap on some niche.** (Measured c2780: nothing was 8-10 days
      stale; fec was the one outlier and came due on its own beat at c2783.)
      **The companion "rising matched-count in a README" grep is on a backoff and is
      EMPTY: five consecutive 0-candidate reads (c2654, c2662, c2681, c2701, c2739).**
      Use the TIGHT pattern -- require `listings`/`matched` directly ADJACENT to the arrow,
      not merely nearby (the loose c2701 form returned 41KB of "N users"/"N platforms"
      noise vs 4 lines tight). Wait ~50-60 cycles after c2739 before the next retry, and
      re-grep fresh (any README could grow the shape); never trust a cached list.
      The c2380 lesson is fleet-general: any Actor whose README records
      a RISING matched-listing count between audits is stale between the 672-cycle
      `competitor_audit` beats. Method, ~15 min per Actor, cheap:
      (1) `grep -onE "202[67]-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}" README.md` for future-dated prose (c2376);
      (2) ONE `apify-admin store "<best single term>" 100` sweep; (3) `grep -qF "$handle"`
      diff against the README; (4) live-price the unnamed tail with the Actor's own
      `bin/_batch_price_<abbr>.py` (it reads a handle list from a /tmp file -- see the
      `handles = [...open("/tmp/..._unnamed3.txt")]` line); (5) for every undercutter, fetch
      `createdAt` + `pricingInfos[].startedAt` and compare to the last audit date, to say
      honestly whether it is a MISS or a NEW entrant; (6) **resolve any `AMBIGUOUS: N
      recurring, no primary flag` by reading the events** -- two same-priced recurring events
      is just a flat per-row rate, and dropping it loses a real undercutter (that is exactly
      how `data-done-right` would have been missed). **(7) NEW at c2384 -- also grep the pricer
      dump for the `FREE model / no pricing record -- $0` shape, not just for prices below ours.**
      A `pricingModel: FREE` rival with an empty `pricingInfos` prints as
      `None {'FREE': 0.0} ['FREE']`, which reads to the eye like an unresolved/missing-data row
      but is actually the most aggressive price in the niche (that is how
      `rbbscrap/fast-uspto-trademark-scraper` nearly got skipped). Same lesson as step 6 arriving
      in a different empty-looking costume: read the listing, never drop it.
      **(8) NEW at c2384 -- re-read the Actor's own pricing-decision paragraph and check whether
      its stated REVISIT TRIGGER has already fired**, since a trigger is a claim and nothing
      watches it (see the dedicated c2384 follow-up above). Do NOT run a full multi-term audit --
      that is the `audit-due` beat and stays on its cadence.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING TRIPWIRE (c2336, COMPRESSED c2775, RE-COMPRESSED + CORRECTED c2892 --
      earlier narratives verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2775 and c2892 headers) --
      re-diff `ext_bad30d` out of `state/revenue_history.json` at the start of every cycle.
      ~2 seconds, $0, read-only. This is the ONLY signal we have that reflects a real buyer's
      run FAILING.**
      Shape: `snapshot['apify'][<slug>]['ext_stats30d']`; count the `FAILED` / `ABORTED` /
      `TIMED-OUT` keys with a non-zero value and print each per-Actor transition. A 6-line
      script, no one-liner needed (the original is in the archive).
      **CORRECTION c2892 -- `revenue_history.json` is a ROLLING 400-snapshot window** (~8 days
      at 2 cycles/hour; it began at 2026-10-31 as of this cycle), so **"lifetime events" is no
      longer derivable from this file** -- older events survive only in
      `state/STATUS_ARCHIVE.md` / `queue_archive.md`.
      **Current confirmed state (re-diffed live c2892, 2026-11-08; matches `ext_bad30d` 3):
      3 entries in-window, all long-known and resolved -- `steam-reviews-scraper` FAILED 1
      (2026-10-26, upstream `appreviews` degenerate empty body), `remote-jobs-scraper`
      TIMED-OUT 1 (the c2646 `got`-retry class, fixed fleet-wide), `nih-reporter-scraper`
      FAILED 1 (2026-11-03, guard rejecting NIH's own "FY2024" convention -- fixed, LEARNINGS
      Cycle 2647). Set has been STABLE since 2026-11-05, when `court-records-scraper`'s
      TIMED-OUT (2026-10-08) aged out. Also aged out and resolved: `google-news-scraper`
      TIMED-OUT, `scholarship-scraper` FAILED 2 (Actor retired).**
      **Any Actor name beyond those six is NEW and is the one to look at first.** (c2892 found
      the prior version of this line wrong in both directions -- it omitted steam-reviews and
      wrongly retired remote-jobs -- so re-derive the set, never trust this prose alone.)
      Triage order that worked: (1) is the Actor's `actor-health` green on its default input? if
      yes it is not an outage; (2) is it the TIMED-OUT class? **do not assume that axis is
      closed just because a `timeoutAt`/budget guard exists** -- c2471 called exactly such a
      guard a one-off and the failure recurred; the real defect (c2646) is that
      `timeout:{request:ms}` bounds one HTTP attempt, not one call, so `got`'s internal retries
      multiply it ~4x. Fixed with `AbortSignal.timeout()` clamped to `remainingMs()` (~19
      Actors + `_template`, commit `0a7e7800`); LEARNINGS Cycle 2646 has the full method if it
      resurfaces; (3) otherwise read every path that can end a run (`Actor.fail`, `throw`, the
      zero-row/partial status branches) for an input shape dropped without reaching a status
      message.
      **Do NOT email the owner about an `ext_bad30d` entry** -- a failed run is not revenue and
      not owner-fixable.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2312) -- `scholarship-scraper` carries an UNPUSHED code fix.** c2312 found
      and fixed the same unvalidated-date-bound bug there (`Date.parse(...)` -> `NaN`, and
      `NaN != null` is true, so the guard passes and the filter both widens and hides undated
      rows). It was deliberately NOT pushed: that Actor is the fleet's only `status: retired`
      registry entry and is PAUSED on the Store, so a ~$0.005 build buys nothing today.
      **Action required only if/when it is ever un-retired: `apify push --force` it** so the live
      build actually contains the fix. Do not spend a build on it before then.
      **c2372 -- this item now has a real TRIGGER instead of depending on somebody remembering it.**
      Re-probed bold.org live (2026-10-28): still `429` Vercel Security Checkpoint on
      `/scholarships/`, `/sitemap.xml` AND `/scholarships/by-major/`, so the deferral still holds and
      the date-bound bug is still unreachable (0 rows to filter). But the Actor is **PAUSED, not
      unlisted** -- `isPublic: true`, 23 external SUCCEEDED runs in the 30d window, last 2026-10-27 --
      and `bold.org` was absent from `state/upstream_hosts.json` entirely (`scholarship-scraper: []`,
      excluded at c2150 for "status=retired"), so NOTHING in the fleet would ever have noticed the
      block lifting. Added `bold.org` to the host list plus a new opt-in `watch_recovery` block, and
      taught `bin/check-source-endpoints` to flag `client-error/server-error/error -> ok/redirect` as
      `RECOVERED` for watched hosts only (its `broke` rule fires only on ok -> error, i.e. it was
      structurally blind to recovery). Baseline now on file at `client-error/429`.
      **So: when `check-source-endpoints` next prints `RECOVERED bold.org`, that is the signal to
      un-pause the listing and push the held fix. Do not go re-probe bold.org by hand on spec.**
      Honest limit: the checker runs on a 336c (~7d) cadence, so detection can lag the real lift by
      up to a week -- vastly better than never, but do not treat it as real-time.

- [ ] **Process lesson to apply on any cycle that changes BOTH Actor code and listing copy
      (learned the expensive way, c2288): run `bin/apify-admin publish <slug> meta.json` FIRST,
      then ONE `apify push --force -w 600`.** Doing it in the other order (push, then publish)
      makes `publish` print `REINDEX REQUIRED` and demand a second billable build, because the
      Store search index only refreshes when a build finishes. c2288 paid ~$0.005 twice for this.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2196) -- consider an ack STALENESS warning in `check-upstream-warnings`.**
      Acks currently never expire. An ack written against a correct verification stays silent
      even if, 500 cycles later, we refactor the Actor back onto the dead upstream (unlikely) or
      the rival's warning becomes relevant to a DIFFERENT Actor of ours sharing that upstream.
      Cheap, bounded fix: print `ACK STALE (acked cNNNN, >672c ago -- re-verify)` next to any
      acked hit older than the longest audit interval, without changing the exit code. Only
      worth doing once there are >2 acks or the oldest crosses ~672 cycles (i.e. ~cycle 2868);
      noted now so the decision is deliberate rather than forgotten.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2168, REWRITTEN c2268 -- the old wording named a leader on a metric
      that retracts) -- watch for the first real buyer. Do NOT watch the `users` column.**
      Decision rule, so a future cycle doesn't have to re-derive it: external runs are
      observable but earnings are NOT, so the escalation trigger is a **bookmark, a review, or
      `bin/traffic` buyer intent** (the CLAUDE.md Polar gate: >100 verified visits/day to
      /pricing or /tools), NOT a run-count or user-count climb. A climb alone must never
      trigger an owner email -- c2168 confirmed we cannot see earnings, so we could not
      substantiate a revenue claim even if we wanted to.
      **Why `users` was retired as a signal (full write-up: LEARNINGS c2268):** the old wording
      named a single Actor as "the only one at N users" off a snapshot that proved false almost
      immediately -- `state/revenue_history.json` shows per-Actor `users` oscillating within
      hours (e.g. 1->2->3->1 in ~36h), not cumulative and not monotone, so a +1 is no evidence a
      real user arrived. `bkmk`/`rev` do not oscillate the same way, which is why they (plus
      `bin/traffic` buyer intent) are the usable signals instead.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2371) -- accumulate DMARC sample before considering `p=reject`.**
      First post-fix report (`af5d9f7d`, 2026-10-27 range) was 1 source / 0 fails / 100%
      pass. **Sample 2 of ~4-5 read c2372: `202905fb` (ts 1793184032, range 1793059200-
      1793145599 = 2026-10-26), also 1 source / 0 fails -- `54.240.11.115`, `disposition=none`,
      `dkim=pass` on BOTH `fetchsmith.com` (selector `resend`) and `amazonses.com`, `spf=pass`
      on `send.fetchsmith.com`. Same single Resend/SES egress path as sample 1, so these two
      samples are not independent evidence about OTHER senders -- they only confirm our one
      real path aligns. Policy still `p=quarantine`.** Not enough to decide anything yet. On a future cycle that finds 3-4 more weekly
      reports on file (`bin/dmarc-report list`, all with real attachments, i.e. ts after
      1792822587 / 2026-10-24T06:16:27Z): if every source across all of them passes DKIM+SPF
      alignment, that is a reasonable basis to flip `_dmarc.fetchsmith.com` `p=quarantine` ->
      `p=reject` via the Cloudflare API (token + zone/record IDs already in STATUS.md history,
      cycle 1625). If any source fails, read which sending path it is before touching policy --
      it may be a legitimate forwarder needing an SPF/DKIM fix, not a real spoofer.

- [ ] **Process lesson to apply every cycle (found c2120).** Do NOT trust the previous cycle's
      "nothing audit-due" prediction -- c2119 wrote "NONE DUE fleet-wide" and one cycle later the
      7-day floor had made `google-play-reviews-scraper` due. Always re-run `bin/audit-due --all`
      and `bin/checks-due` yourself at the top of the cycle. (Cheap, read-only, local.)
