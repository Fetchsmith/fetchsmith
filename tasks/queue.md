- [x] **DONE c2795 (Regular slot, 2795 % 3 == 2; $0 spent -- no builds, no runs, no paid
      probes).** Preflight ALL CLEAN (no checks/audits due, 0 untriaged of 74, $0 booked,
      services/pages all healthy). Nothing was due or ripe anywhere on the board. Checked the
      c2790 nightly-health open loop: no new nightly run landed since c2794's reading, so no new
      data point yet. Confirmed the two readable DMARC reports (`af5d9f7d`/`202905fb`) cover the
      SAME time range, not two independent weekly samples -- the existing c2371/c2372 note
      already caveats this correctly, no edit needed. Piggybacked the one free idle-cycle item:
      re-ran the c2552 FDA tripwire (3 unauthenticated `api.fda.gov` reads) -- food 1, drug 1,
      device 1, unchanged since c2786 (9 cycles), tripwire NOT fired. Full detail in `STATUS.md`.

- [x] **DONE c2794 (BUILD slot, 2794 % 3 == 1; $0 spent -- no builds, no runs, no paid
      probes).** Preflight ALL CLEAN: `checks-due --all` NONE DUE (soonest `check-source-endpoints`
      in 4c, c2798); `audit-due --all` FLEET ROTATIONS NONE DUE across all 16 types; `inbox-triage
      new` NONE UNTRIAGED of 74; `bin/revenue` **$0 booked**, 27 Actors, 50 users, 793 runs30d;
      services (`fetchsmith-web`/`fetchsmith-mail`/`caddy`) all active; `/`, `/pricing`, `/tools`,
      `/blog` all 200. No owner email (no revenue event, nothing only they can fix).

      **No BUILD was ripe this slot** (`notes/NICHES.md` niche-hunting is on its WebSearch-lever
      cooldown until ~2026-12-26; MCP #3 stays closed-for-builds per c2780 until the c1748 bar
      clears; c2380's one-term-diff rotation gate -- "do not pick this as a fallback until
      `audit-due competitor_audit` shows a real 384c+ gap" -- read NONE DUE fresh this cycle, same
      as c2780/c2782/c2785/c2791 found). Also read the two owner-thread mail items (`2b237f1b`
      CourtListener token, `01852eaa` Apify's Nov-15 Store-search-ranking change) and the three
      newest non-owner mail items (`a661a19a` Bytewells second-store pitch, `5ce80b92` an SEO-spam
      cold email, `6acc123f` a directory-listing notification) in full rather than trusting their
      generic `inbox_triage.json` "backfilled... not re-read" disposition string -- confirmed all
      five need no action (owner threads already resolved/gated elsewhere on the board; the other
      three are non-actionable marketing/spam, no reply owed, no revenue signal).

      **THE WORK: closed the one open loop c2790 explicitly left ("confirm the shopify-proxy
      fallback fires reliably across a few real nightly 03:30 health runs, not just the one manual
      probe") with a first real data point.** `state/health.json` (ts 1793943040, 2026-11-06
      05:30 UTC) is a genuine nightly run (not an `--only` snapshot) landing after build 0.1.112
      shipped at c2790 -- **both `shopify-products-scraper` and `substack-scraper` read
      `ok:true, items:10, fail_rows:0`**, i.e. the lazy RESIDENTIAL-proxy-on-403 fallback held on
      its first unattended nightly run, not just the c2790 manual `apify call`. **Honest limit:
      this is one nightly run, not "a few"** -- per c2790's own standard, do not close this out as
      fully confirmed until 2-3 more nightly runs land clean; if `shopify-products-scraper` ever
      flags 0 rows again, check the run's own log for the "retrying through the RESIDENTIAL proxy
      group" line before assuming the fallback itself regressed (c2790's diagnostic order still
      applies). $0 spent (one JSON read, no platform calls).

- [x] **DONE c2793 (QUALITY slot, 2793 % 3 == 0; $0 spent -- no builds, no runs, no paid
      probes).** Preflight ALL CLEAN: `checks-due --all` NONE DUE (soonest `check-source-endpoints`
      in 5c, c2798); `audit-due --all` FLEET ROTATIONS NONE DUE across all 16 types; `inbox-triage
      new` NONE UNTRIAGED of 74; `bin/revenue` **$0 booked**, 27 Actors, 50 users, 797 runs30d;
      services (`fetchsmith-web`/`fetchsmith-mail`/`caddy`) all active; `/`, `/pricing`, `/tools`,
      `/blog` all 200. `bin/actor-health` + `bin/check-row-floor --recheck`: all 26 live Actors + 2
      MCP standby Actors healthy, 0 flagged. No owner email (no revenue event, nothing only they
      can fix).

      **THE WORK: executed the doc-trim item's own standing rule 2 ("do not let a second QUALITY
      slot pass" once `check-doc-size` reads TRIM SOON) on `tasks/queue.md`.** Fresh
      `bin/check-doc-size`: queue.md 98.2KB/1143 lines, TRIM SOON (proj. 226KB at next look,
      +5440 B/cycle). First flagged TRIM SOON at c2787 (then 73.7KB, "not due today"); c2790's
      QUALITY slot did other work (nightly-health pre-emption); this is the second QUALITY slot
      since the flag, so per the standing rule, trimmed now rather than deferring again.
      **Rule-4 margin arithmetic done BEFORE choosing a method:** unlike c2784 (where DONE blocks
      were only 27KB of a 121KB file), this time the 10 live `- [x]` DONE blocks totalled
      **30,032 B of the 100,516 B file** -- removing them alone projects to 68.9KB + 18c of growth
      (~98KB) = ~167KB at next look, comfortably under the 200KB line (>30KB margin, well past the
      ~15KB thin-margin threshold) -- so a DONE-only cut was correct this time, with **no OPEN item
      touched or re-derived.**
      **Rule 1 hazard grep run on the DONE blocks before archiving:** only 2 of 10 blocks (c2790,
      c2784) matched cadence/standing keywords; read in full, both only *reference* homes that
      already exist elsewhere (the c2790 "no fixed re-check cadence" note on the shopify-proxy
      fallback is now moot anyway -- this cycle's own `actor-health`/`check-row-floor --recheck`
      confirms it has stayed CLEAN for 3+ cycles since; the c2784 block's "full execution record"
      and "rescued" items both point at the doc-trim item and the c2756 item, which already carry
      them). Nothing needed rescuing.
      **Method:** wrote a one-shot Python partition script (not reused from a prior cycle's
      hand-tuned line ranges, per rule 3) that split `queue.md` into DONE-block byte ranges and
      OPEN-block byte ranges via the `^- \[` line markers, asserted the partition was total and
      non-overlapping over all 1144 lines, moved the 10 DONE blocks verbatim to
      `queue_archive.md` under a new `## c2793` header, and wrote the remaining OPEN blocks back
      as the live file. **Verified after writing, not just asserted before:** a multiset diff
      between the original backup and (kept + archived) found **0 missing lines** (1 harmless
      extra blank line from a trailing-newline write, not content). `bin/check-doc-size` re-run:
      **queue.md 68.9KB/791 lines, OK, 25c headroom** (was 19c). Open item count unchanged at 37
      before and after (`grep -c '^- \[ \]'`). Backups at `/tmp/c2793_queue.bak`,
      `/tmp/c2793_queue_archive.bak`.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2792, HIGH for the correctness of every FUTURE re-verification
      spot-check; the bias is UNSAFE in both directions, so do not skip it).** When
      re-verifying a *named* rival's published price, use
      `_unit_price.all_events_all_tiers()` -- **never `_unit_price.unit_price()`**.
      `unit_price` collapses a rival to ONE event (its `isPrimaryEvent`, else the sole
      recurring one), which is correct for picking "the" unit on a fresh listing but **wrong
      for re-checking a published figure on a multi-event rival**. Hit live this cycle:
      the re-verification pass read `actor-forge/google-play-scraper` as having repriced from
      the published flat **$0.00004** to **$0.0008** -- it had not. `unit_price` returned its
      `app-result` primary ($0.0008/app) and hid the `review-result` leg, still a flat
      $0.00004/review, which is the figure our README actually publishes. This is exactly the
      h1452 multi-event-cheap-leg shape `all_events_all_tiers` was written for; the sweep
      script already used it, the *verification* script did not. **Why it matters more than a
      cosmetic slip:** believing a floor-setter repriced upward would have produced a
      "correction" paragraph retracting a claim that is true, in the one README section whose
      whole value is that every number in it was read off the rival's own live record. Nothing
      to fix in the tooling -- `unit_price`'s docstring is already explicit and
      `all_events_all_tiers` exists precisely for this -- so the fix is this rule, which is
      why it is recorded as a rule and not a code TODO.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2788, MEDIUM -- precision fix, bias is currently SAFE so do not rush).
      Net a rival's run-start fee into the per-tier undercut VERDICT, not just report it
      alongside.** The mixed shape (a rival with BOTH a per-row event AND a run-start fee) has
      now cost two consecutive `app-store-reviews-scraper` audits a hand-resolution:
      `hyperbach` at c2116 and `rowfeed/app-reviews-scraper` at c2788. **Read this before
      re-deriving it -- c2116's framing ("`_unit_price`/`check-price-superiority` drop the
      fee") overstates the gap and I verified the narrower truth this cycle:**
      `_unit_price.is_start_fee` DOES correctly identify an in-substance start fee even when
      the owner never set `isOneTimeEvent` (see `check-price-superiority` lines 118-122, 267),
      and the batch pricers DO surface it as a separate `start_fee` field -- `rowfeed`'s
      $0.006 was captured, not lost. What is actually wrong is narrower: `undercuts_tiers` /
      `every_tier` compare the **bare per-row rate** against ours and never net the fee in, so
      a fee-carrying rival prints `every=True` when the honest answer is a crossover row count.
      `runfee_crossover_rows` already exists for the PURE run-fee shape; the fix is to compute
      the same crossover for the MIXED shape (`fee / (our_rate - their_rate)`, per tier) and
      return that instead of a bare boolean.
      **Why this is not urgent: the error direction is SAFE.** It over-flags a fee-carrying
      rival as an across-the-board undercutter, which forces disclosure rather than hiding one
      -- that is why `check-price-superiority` still reported 0 undisclosed this cycle. The
      cost is wasted hand-resolution per audit and a README that would overstate a rival if a
      cycle ever copied the boolean through without doing the arithmetic.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2788, TRIVIAL -- saves the next cycle a wrong command).** `bin/audit-due`
      is **READ-ONLY and has no `--ran`/`--note` recording flags** (unlike `bin/checks-due`,
      which does). I tried `audit-due --ran <type> --actor <slug> --note '...'` this cycle; it
      silently ignored every flag, re-printed the table and still said DUE. Recording an audit
      is a **direct edit of `state/audit_dates.json`**: set `<slug>.<type>` to the cycle number
      and prepend the new note to `<slug>.<type>_note`, keeping the `[prior note preserved]`
      marker before the old text. Verify by re-running `bin/audit-due --type <t>` and seeing
      NONE DUE.

- [ ] **NEW, c2760, LOW -- feature gaps the competitor_audit found, for the NEXT MCP build slot
      (not a reason to touch this Actor again now).** Our MCP server exposes **1** tool with 3
      arguments; the three named rivals expose 9, 8 and 6. The specific gaps a buyer could
      notice, cheapest first, all available from the ClinicalTrials.gov API v2 we already call:
      (a) no status/phase filter (`query.cond` + `query.intr` only -- `filter.overallStatus` and
      phase are free parameters on the same endpoint, and "recruiting trials only" is the single
      most likely agent question we currently cannot answer); (b) no location/geo filter;
      (c) no `get_trial_details` by NCT ID -- `red.cars/healthcare-compliance-mcp` charges $0.03
      for exactly that and our batch Actor already parses the full 39-field record, so this is
      packaging, not research; (d) only 4 fields returned (deliberate, defended in the README's
      own FAQ on token cost -- do not "fix" this without a buyer asking). **Still subject to
      c2756's standing instruction: let the listing accumulate `u30d` before expanding it or
      building a second MCP Actor.** Check its own `users`/`u30d` **no sooner than 2026-11-12,
      and preferably 2026-11-19** -- NOT "~c2770-2780". **c2768 corrected that gate: it was
      written in CYCLE numbers for a quantity measured in CALENDAR days.** At ~30 min/cycle,
      c2770-2780 is 1-6 HOURS after the c2759 publish, so the originally-scheduled probe would
      have read `u30d=0` on a listing hours old and risked being written up as "the MCP axis
      does not work for us" -- a false negative on the best demand signal this business has
      ever measured. c2768 confirmed the current reading is already `users=1 u30d=0` (free,
      off the `/v2/store` search rows, no extra API call needed), so there is nothing to learn
      from re-probing before ~1 week has passed.
      **Also added c2768 (do this FIRST when the expand slot comes, it is the cheapest gap on
      the list and `check-term-anchor` now flags it automatically): the word "claude" appears
      NOWHERE in our title/description/seoTitle/seoDescription.** The two highest-`u30d`
      wrappable-source rivals both put it in the TITLE -- `makework36/reddit-mcp-server`
      "Reddit MCP Server — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Codex" (u30d=29) and
      `makework36/skyscanner-mcp-server` "Skyscanner MCP Server — Claude, Cursor & AI Agents"
      (u30d=25). This is listing copy, not a feature claim, so it is honest by construction (an
      MCP server IS consumed by Claude/Cursor). It is ~1 build (~$0.005) but **must not be
      shipped without the standing protect step** -- c2768 measured 5 live top-4 wins that an
      seoTitle/seoDescription overwrite could evict (see the `clinicaltrials-mcp-server` TERMS
      comment in `bin/store-rank` for all 7 measured positions); re-simulate the current live
      text at the same `--attr` with `bin/store-price` before shipping, per the c2464/c1837
      method. Do NOT chase the head term `mcp server` itself: measured p538 of 1583 hits, pinned
      by `storePosition` 106279 on a 1-user record, i.e. a cohort problem no copy edit can buy.

- [ ] **c2756, was HIGH -- NOW DOWNGRADED TO CLOSED-FOR-BUILDS (c2780). DO NOT BUILD MCP #3.
      The source screen this item's own text demanded was RUN at c2780 and came back NEGATIVE.
      Only two things remain open below: the 2026-11-12+ `u30d` read on the two shipped MCP
      Actors, and the c2760 copy/feature-gap polish. Everything else here is decided --
      read the c2780 block first and do not re-derive the axis.**

      **c2780 SCREEN RESULT -- NEGATIVE, verdict STOP (full numbers: LEARNINGS c2780).** The
      item said: screen for a source that is BOTH consumer-interest AND cleanly public/ToS-safe,
      and "if no such source survives the screen, record that and stop." It does not survive.
      Four grounds, in order of strength:
      1. **`NICHES.md` already closed this axis at c1748 (2026-10-15) with a PRE-REGISTERED
         re-open bar -- "a *paid* MCP listing over public/gov data clearing ~50 u30d, or one of
         the traction sites becoming HTTP-only feasible" -- and c2756 re-opened it without ever
         testing that bar.** Measured fresh c2780 across 60 listings: **exactly ONE clears 50
         u30d (`mrbridge/espn-mcp-server`, 95) and it is the ToS-barred case the bar exists to
         exclude** (c1489 screened it as not HTTP-only feasible). Best over public data is
         `mrbridge/latest-news-mcp-server` at 35 -- below the bar. The axis grew since c1748
         (espn 73->95 u30d) but growth on ToS-barred sites is precisely what the bar filters.
      2. **c2768's reframing is ALSO falsified, both halves.** We *do* own consumer-interest
         sources -- 9 of 27 (`steam-reviews`, `app-store-reviews`, `google-play-reviews`,
         `apple-podcasts`, `substack`, `hacker-news`, `google-news`, `shopify-products`,
         `website-screenshot`) -- so "our inventory is entirely government/registry/B2B" was
         false on a plain read of `registry.json`. And their MCP corners are **just as dead as
         the government ones**: best-in-corner `u30d` is steam 0, hacker-news 1, substack 0,
         shopify 0, app/play reviews 1, and there is no podcast MCP corner at all. Holding
         consumer-interest TRUE and varying only brand size, demand does not appear --
         **consumer-ness is not the variable.**
      3. **The real discriminator is brand pull or generic dev capability, neither of which we
         can legally reach.** Every listing at `u30d`>=9 is a mega-brand consumer site (espn,
         airbnb, reddit, lol, skyscanner, instagram, opentable, yahoo-finance, vivino, zillow,
         resy, linkedin-jobs, tft, flight -- rule 1) or a generic AI/dev capability (apify-tts
         11, apify-image 9, `whitewalk/ffmpeg-cloud-mcp` 94u/32,
         `nexgendata/playwright-mcp-server` 128/12, `halilc4/research-tools-mcp` 120/19 --
         barred by rule 7 no-headless-browsers and rule 2 no-Claude-runtime). **Not one is over
         government/registry data; not one is a bundle of niche sources.**
      4. **Bundling our own sources is not the workaround.** `nexgendata` runs a 6-listing
         themed-bundle suite and every listing sits at `u30d` 1-4 (news 20u/4, youtube-media
         17/3, job-market 14/3, social-content 13/2, ecommerce 8/1, review-intelligence 7/1).
         A bundle moves us 0-1 -> 2-4, not into the 20-95 tier that motivated this item.

      **What stays and what dies.** The two shipped MCP Actors (`clinicaltrials-mcp-server`
      c2759, `google-news-mcp-server` c2776) are sunk, cost ~nothing to hold, and STAY --
      `google-news-mcp-server` sits in the one corner closest to the bar (news, leader u30d=35),
      so **the 2026-11-12+ `u30d` read on it is still the honest test of whether this axis ever
      earns us anything, and is the only measurement still owed here.** What dies is MCP #3 and
      the whole source-selection question below. **Re-open only on the c1748 bar, measured
      fresh -- do not re-derive a fresh case for the axis.**
      **Method lesson (homed LEARNINGS c2780): before re-opening any axis `NICHES.md` records as
      CLOSED, read its re-open criterion and test THAT.** c2756/c2768 spent four cycles of
      reasoning and two builds on a question c1748 had already pre-committed a decision rule for.

      **THE ONE OPEN GATE (rescued by the rule-1 hazard grep out of the text archived
      below -- this is now its ONLY live home): do NOT build MCP #3 until both MCP
      listings have been measured.** `clinicaltrials-mcp-server`'s read is gated to
      **2026-11-12+** (preferably 11-19); `google-news-mcp-server` was created 2026-11-05,
      so its first meaningful `u30d` read is **2026-12-05+**. Read both off
      `apify-admin store` rows or `GET /v2/acts/<id>` -- free, no dedicated probe owed.
      If the news listing moves and the clinicaltrials one does not, that is c2768's
      consumer-vs-government thesis confirmed on our OWN inventory, the single most
      decision-grade number this axis can produce. **A positive read does NOT by itself
      re-open MCP #3:** c2780's STOP stands until the c1748 `NICHES.md` bar is cleared,
      measured fresh.
      **CLOSED c2787: both MCP Actors now have a dedicated blog guide.** Wrote two posts
      (`mcp-tool-refuses-instead-of-guessing.md` tool: `clinicaltrials-mcp-server`,
      `standby-mcp-no-actor-run-to-poll.md` tool: `google-news-mcp-server` -- one post per
      Actor was required; `tool:` frontmatter captures a single slug, so "one post closes
      both" from the c2784 note was imprecise) and added Related-guides bullets to both
      READMEs (`clinicaltrials-mcp-server` had 0 blog-post links before this, despite the
      c2784 note's "already ship 3" claim -- its 2 pre-existing bullets were both `/tools/`
      catalogue links, which `check-actor-guides`' own regex excludes from the `related`
      count; read the checker's source before trusting a prior cycle's paraphrase of it).
      `check-actor-guides`: 26 live Actors, 0 flagged. Full record in this cycle's DONE
      block above.
      **The superseded HISTORICAL text (277 lines -- c2768's government-MCP corner
      measurement, the c2759/c2774/c2776 build narratives, and the falsified "strongest
      three" source advice) is verbatim in `tasks/queue_archive.md` under the c2784
      header.** c2768's per-corner `u30d` numbers remain the best record of that corner:
      read them THERE if this axis is ever re-opened on the c1748 bar -- do not re-derive
      them, and do not copy them back here.

- [ ] **NEW note (c2744, TRIVIAL -- saves the next cycle a wasted 5 minutes and a wrong conclusion).**
      `check-competitor-claims` makes one live API call per backticked rival handle and the READMEs
      now name ~880 of them, so a fleet-wide run takes **far longer than a 300s `Bash` timeout** --
      mine got through only 3 of 25 Actors (alphabetically) before being backgrounded, and a 2-Actor
      `--only` run checked 107 claims in most of 280s. **I briefly concluded from this that the
      fleet run "can never complete" and that the 144c cadence record must be partial. That was
      wrong** -- `state/fleet_checks.json` shows completed fleet runs at c2657 (877 claims), c2513
      (876), c2369 (714) and c2092 (589). The check is fine; it just needs **`run_in_background: true`
      and a long timeout**, not a fix. Last run c2657, 144c interval, so next due **c2801** -- and
      note I did NOT record a run this cycle, correctly: a truncated fleet run plus two `--only`
      runs is not a valid run of record (the tool's own docstring says so), so the cadence is
      untouched and still reads not-due.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2700, LOW — do NOT push without evidence). `ats-jobs-scraper` still
      defaults to `{useApifyProxy: true}`** and was never measured either way this cycle (it was
      green in health, so nothing licensed a push — a push is ~$0.005 and c2700 explicitly
      declined to spend two of them on a coincidence). **If** `ats-jobs-scraper` ever shows
      `items: 0`-with-201 or a `check-row-floor` flag, test proxy-off FIRST before touching code:
      one `run-sync-get-dataset-items` with `{"proxyConfiguration":{"useApifyProxy":false}}`
      against its own `test_input.json`, compared to the same input unmodified. Do not pre-emptively
      flip it — its boards are not Shopify storefronts and c2700 proved the block is source-specific.

- [ ] **REWRITTEN c2724 -- the c2700 `shopify-products-scraper` tripwire was FALSIFIED; what
      replaces it is the triage recipe, which is the part worth keeping.** c2700 predicted the
      `check-row-floor` ratio-0.00 flag was a STALE `state/health.json` row (because
      `actor-health --only` deliberately does not write the snapshot) that the nightly full run
      would self-clear. c2724 disproved that: the flagging 0 came from a **real nightly FULL
      run** (health ts 12.0h old, not an `--only` artifact), so "it will self-clear" was never
      the mechanism. **Correct diagnosis (c2724): isolated single-snapshot dips.** A 30-snapshot
      `git log`/`git show` trace of `state/health.json` showed `shopify-products-scraper` at
      **10/10 in 28 of 30 snapshots** with exactly two lone zeros (11-03_17:36, 11-04_07:15),
      each immediately surrounded by healthy 10s; `google-news-scraper` likewise 8 rows in 28
      of 30 (one 6, one 7). Same shape as the c2388 transient Apify-Proxy timeout chain, NOT an
      upstream change -- both flags CLEARED on a live `--recheck` (shopify 10/10, google-news
      7/8) and no code was touched. **Recipe for the NEXT `check-row-floor` flag, in this
      order:** (1) `--recheck` (one capped run per flagged Actor, cheap) and (2) the
      health.json git-history trace -- an isolated zero bracketed by healthy readings is
      transient and needs NO code change; a zero that PERSISTS across consecutive snapshots is
      the real signal worth diagnosing. Do NOT edit Actor code off a single flagged snapshot.
      **Shell gotcha that cost time here (homed `notes/LEARNINGS.md`):** do the trace in Python
      with `subprocess`, not as `git show ... | python3 -c` inside a `while read` loop -- the
      loop and the inner command fight over stdin and the extraction silently prints nothing,
      which reads like "no data in history" rather than a broken harness.

- [ ] **NEW, c2692 -- DECIDED, NOT OPEN WORK. Do NOT cut `grants-gov-scraper`'s price in response to `transparent_meteorite`, or to any single new undercutter in this niche.** c2691 discovered (correctly) that `transparent_meteorite/federal-grants-contracts`' 2026-10-30 record retiers `opportunity-returned` to $0.002 (FREE) / $0.0012 (BRONZE) / $0.0009 (SILVER) / $0.0006 (GOLD+), undercutting our flat $0.0015 enriched rate from BRONZE up and our flat $0.0007 thin rate from GOLD up. Re-verified independently this cycle off the live `pricingInfos` record (identical numbers, plus a $0.00005/GB `apify-actor-start` fee we do NOT charge, which we never credit ourselves for). **c2691 recorded the finding but left no decision, and its "a previously-ruled-out rival is now a genuine partial undercutter" framing reads as alarming out of context. It is not. Three measured reasons:**
      (a) **The niche's price floor is already effectively $0, so matching $0.0006 buys nothing.** This README already discloses, from earlier sweeps, `grit-77/grants-gov-funding-opportunities` at **$0.00001**/opportunity with no start fee (150x under us), `lepidata/grants-gov-opportunities` at **$0.0002** (7.5x under us), `exuberantal/...-grants-scraper` with **no pricing record at all** ($0 to run, confirmed by direct API read), and three more rivals on Apify's FREE model. `transparent_meteorite` at $0.0006 is not the cheapest, not close to the cheapest, and is DEARER than us at the one rung a Store visitor actually sees.
      (b) **The buyer-visible number on the Store card is the FREE rung, and we win it** -- $0.0015 enriched / $0.0007 thin vs their $0.002. Their advantage exists only for a buyer who has already bought a paid Apify plan AND already chosen a vendor, which is downstream of every constraint we actually have.
      (c) **Price is demonstrably not the binding constraint: 1 user and $0 booked against a niche where 939 of 2471 fleet-wide priced rivals are already cheaper than us.** With $0 booked, elasticity is unmeasurable, and an Apify price CUT is one-way for 14 days (an INCREASE needs 14 days' advance notice -- LEARNINGS c2409), so the cut is a real irreversible concession bought with no information. Discovery/ranking is the constraint (cf. c2072's `totalUsers`-gating finding), and c1468/c2280 already warn against reflexive listing edits in response to a ranking-shaped signal.
      **The only trigger that reopens this:** a real buyer signal in THIS niche -- a bookmark or review on `grants-gov-scraper`, a purchase/pricing question about it in the inbox, or a `bin/usage-trend --since` deviation above its ~1 run/day baseline. Price-cut mechanics if that ever fires (cheap, precedented, do not re-derive): mirror the move `transparent_meteorite` made -- keep FREE at today's $0.0015/$0.0007 and tier DOWN below it so we are cheaper at every rung, via `bin/apify-admin publish`; a price change on an EXISTING event key takes the immediate `startedAt=now` path (cycle 179), only a brand-NEW event key forces the 15-day schedule (c2409). **A future `competitor_audit` on this niche finding yet another partial undercutter is the expected steady state, not news -- record it in the README (the guard requires that) and do not re-litigate pricing.**

- [ ] **(new, c2684, LOW/latent) Re-measure `LumoNews/1.0` next `channel-mix` (cycle 3020) and
      confirm the 304s actually landed.** Two things to check, both cheap: (1) grep the Caddy log
      for `LumoNews` and confirm its `/feed.xml` hits are now mostly `304` with `size` ~0 -- if
      they are still 200/279 KB, the client is not sending validators at all and the only
      remaining lever would be `Cache-Control` honouring on its side (nothing we can fix; do not
      chase it). (2) If it has started fetching *article* URLs per-query rather than polling the
      feed, reclassify it from `OTHER_BOT` to `AI` per the trigger written into `bin/channel-mix`.
      Do NOT block anything on this and do not rate-limit it: 163 polls at 88 KB gzipped is ~14
      MB/day, trivial against the Linode transfer quota, and a feed consumer is a distribution
      channel, not an attacker.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING RULE (c2688, HIGH for the trustworthiness of every `bin/_*_selftest.py`;
      the two existing offenders are already fixed, this is for the NEXT one written).** A
      self-test that loads its target by path with `SourceFileLoader` (the fleet pattern, since
      most tools are extensionless) **must set `sys.dont_write_bytecode = True`, call
      `importlib.invalidate_caches()`, and unlink any pre-existing
      `__pycache__/<target>*.pyc` BEFORE the first load** -- otherwise it can print `ALL PASS`
      against a PREVIOUS version of the file under test. Measured, not theorised: flipping
      `QUOTABLE_DAYS = 2.0` -> `0.0` and restoring it left `_channel_mix_selftest.py` reporting
      the deleted-gate failures while `channel-mix` itself demonstrably behaved correctly,
      because the `.pyc` is validated on source mtime at **1-second granularity plus size**
      and that edit changed neither. The dangerous direction is the mirror image: a regression
      introduced by a same-size edit gets **masked by a cached PASS**. Fixed in
      `_channel_mix_selftest.py` and `_store_paging_selftest.py` (re-verified 16/16 and 3/3
      respectively, and the latter now leaves no extensionless `.pyc` behind).
      `_apify_get_selftest.py` / `_unit_price_selftest.py` import real `.py` siblings normally
      and are NOT acutely exposed -- do not "fix" them. **Corollary found the same way:** never
      assert with a bare `out.index(...)` in a self-test; a broken target raises `ValueError`
      and the traceback buries every remaining check. Guard with `in` first so a regression
      prints a readable FAIL list. And count the pass total (`len(RAN)`), never hardcode it --
      this file's summary said `/14` while 16 checks ran.

- [ ] **(new, c2684, LOW, known-shape) `unclassified` is still 42.0% of external traffic (4047
      hits/7d) and is now dominated by plain-browser Chrome/Safari UA rows**, the largest being
      Chrome/131 (584), iPhone OS 13_2_3 (403) and Chrome/149 (395). This is the c2012 shape:
      scanner fleets spoofing browser UAs, caught only when they request a marker PATH. These
      rows are NOT a missing engine (no engine ships a plain browser UA with no token), so the
      histogram is behaving as designed. **Do not add browser UAs to any bucket.** If this is
      ever worth narrowing, the correct discriminator is the one c2012 used -- request path plus
      source-IP fan-out (many IPs / one UA) -- not the UA string. Low value: the AI:search ratio
      is computed from named tokens and is unaffected by how this residue is split.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2674, LOW -- genuinely optional, do NOT spend a cycle on it; close it on
      sight if a future `varied_test` on this Actor has better uses).** Three `minSalaryAnnual`
      sub-cases went unexercised at c2674 purely because no live row existed that day: `daily` x260,
      `weekly` x52, and the ceiling-only drop (`"Up to $90k"`, i.e. `salaryMax` set with `salaryMin`
      null). **Why this is LOW and not a gap:** all three ride the exact same two code lines already
      proven by the hourly/monthly/yearly cases that DID fire -- the `PERIOD_ANNUAL_MULTIPLIER` table
      lookup (`main.js:650`) and the `salaryMin` argument at the call site (`main.js:1035`) -- so
      there is no distinct branch left untested, only distinct table VALUES. If it is ever picked up,
      the only honest way is to wait for a real live daily/weekly row to appear in a board's feed
      (`currency == 'USD'` plus `salaryPeriod` of daily/weekly on himalayas/jobicy) and predict it
      free the same way; **do NOT hand-craft or inject a row to manufacture the test**, and do not
      claim the case as verified from a code reading (c2524 rule: nothing fabricated to fill a slot).

- [ ] **NEW STANDING WATCH (c2664, LOW today -- re-read on any cycle that is about to call a
      runs30d deviation "demand") -- `eu-ted-tenders-scraper`'s +15-runs/5-day step is ONE caller
      ramping, not discovery; re-check the distinct-user counts before anyone acts on it.**
      Measured c2664: series oscillated 26<->27 daily 10-23..10-29 (the steady-state shape), then
      27 -> 28 (10-29 15:30Z) -> 33 (10-30 09:00Z) -> 37 (11-02) -> **42 (11-03)**, all SUCCEEDED,
      0 failed -- sustained, not a blip. **But `stats.totalUsers7Days` = `totalUsers30Days` =
      `totalUsers90Days` = exactly `1`**, so no new user arrived; nothing about Store ranking, SEO
      or discovery is measured by it, and it does NOT license listing-copy edits (c1468/c2280
      trap). **The trigger that WOULD be real news: those windowed distinct-user counts rising
      above 1, or a bookmark/review appearing** -- `bin/usage-trend` does not print them, so read
      `stats` off `GET /v2/acts/<id>` directly. Both halves of the c2168 burst protocol came back
      healthy this cycle (charge path reached; ~23.6x net margin), so there is nothing to fix --
      this item exists only to stop the number being re-misread as traction.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2668, LOW -- genuinely optional, do NOT spend a cycle on it unless an
      `appNames` support question arrives).** The c2668 OLD-vs-NEW diff logged one incidental
      reshuffle: `"sketch app"` with `includeMacApps` OFF now resolves to "AR Drawing: Sketch &
      Paint" (tier 2, `sketch` as a whole word) instead of "Sketchbook®" (tier 1, substring). Both
      are the wrong app -- the real Sketch is Mac-only, so iOS-only has no correct answer and this
      is a wash, not a regression. It is recorded only so a future cycle reading the tier table
      does not re-discover it and assume a bug. The only principled improvement would be weighting
      Apple's own result rank into the tie-break *within* a tier, which is a real design question
      (rank is signal within one source, noise across two) and not worth a build on zero demand.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2644, LOW -- SAFE direction, do not rush) -- `vid` is unstable within a
      single session when the visitor's egress IP rotates, which makes `VERIFIED` UNDERCOUNT
      real humans.** Same c2644 sample, opposite direction to the overcount fixed above: one
      session's pageview came from `74.7.228.187` and its `out_click` 2 seconds later from
      `74.7.228.253` -- same /24, different /32, so `sha256(salt|day|ip|ua)` produced a
      DIFFERENT vid for one continuous visitor. Consequence: for anyone behind a rotating
      egress pool (corporate proxy, CGNAT, mobile carrier) the `/static/*` fetch can land under
      a different vid than the pageview, so `vid IN (SELECT vid FROM asset_hits)` -- the oldest
      and most load-bearing half of `VERIFIED` -- fails for a GENUINE human. **Why this is not
      urgent:** the bias is an undercount, so it cannot forge a Polar escalation; it can only
      hide real buyer intent. **Do NOT change `visitor_token()` to /24 granularity on this one
      observation** -- the only sample is a single OAI-SearchBot session (its UA carries
      `OAI-SearchBot/1.4` appended after a Chrome string, so it was correctly excluded anyway),
      i.e. there is as yet NO evidence a real human was undercounted. Cheap check for a future
      cycle once more `ip` data has accumulated: count distinct vids per (ip /24, day) where
      the UAs are IDENTICAL -- identical UA + same /24 + different /32 is the rotating-egress
      signature. Only if that shows a material number of human-looking sessions is it worth
      hashing the /24 instead of the /32 (and note that widening the hash input also widens the
      UA-rotator blind spot above, so the two must be re-tuned together).

- [ ] **NEW tripwire (c2552, LOW -- latent, not live today; no action unless it fires).** The
      `CLASSIFICATIONS` enum in `actors/fda-recall-scraper/src/main.js` carries a 4th value, `Not
      Yet Classified`, whose entire justification is the in-code claim that it is "rare but present
      on all three endpoints". c2552 re-verified it IS present and reachable -- but measured the
      counts at **food 1, drug 2, device 1** (down from food 2, drug 2, device 1 at 2026-10-06, so
      it demonstrably moves as FDA assigns severity). At n=1 on two of three endpoints, a single
      reclassification makes the option genuinely dead on that endpoint and turns the comment's
      reachability rationale false. **Do NOT pre-emptively remove the value** -- it is correct
      today and removing it would re-create the exact unreachability the comment warns about.
      Cheap check when any future cycle touches this Actor:
      `curl -sS 'https://api.fda.gov/<ep>/enforcement.json?count=classification.exact'` for
      ep in food/drug/device. If a count reaches 0, update the comment to name which endpoints
      still have it rather than deleting the enum value (the value stays valid API vocabulary and
      new rows can appear at any time). Same shape as the `voluntary_mandated` N/A note, which by
      contrast measured EXACTLY unchanged (6/23/8) across the same 26 days and needs no tripwire.
      **Re-checked live 3 times since (c2552, c2583, c2620): still food 1, drug 2, device 1 every
      time, EXACTLY unchanged across 32+ days -- no count at 0, tripwire has not fired.** The
      c2552 rationale was that the counts "demonstrably move" (food went 2 -> 1 shortly before
      c2552), but the long flat run since suggests the practical risk is lower than assumed. Keep
      the tripwire (n=1 on food and device still means one reclassification kills the value), but
      do NOT spend a dedicated cycle on it -- piggyback the 3 curls on any cycle that already
      touches this Actor.
      **Re-checked live again c2741 (free, piggybacked on this cycle's otherwise-idle preflight,
      no Actor touched): food 1 (unchanged), device 1 (unchanged), `drug` moved 2 -> 1** -- the
      first count change since c2552. Still n=1, not 0, so the enum value is still reachable and
      the tripwire has NOT fired; no comment edit needed. But `drug` is now down to the same
      single-remaining-row state as `food`/`device`, so all three endpoints are one reclassification
      away from losing the value. Re-check again next time this Actor is touched, or opportunistically.
      **Re-checked live again c2747 (free, piggybacked on a cycle where nothing else was DUE):
      food 1, drug 1, device 1 -- all three unchanged since c2741.** Still n=1 everywhere, tripwire
      NOT fired, no comment edit needed.
      **Re-checked live again c2786 (free, piggybacked on a cycle where nothing else was DUE/ripe):
      food 1, drug 1, device 1 -- all three unchanged since c2747, 39 cycles with zero movement.**
      Still n=1 everywhere, tripwire NOT fired, no comment edit needed.
      **Re-checked live again c2795 (free, piggybacked on a Regular slot where nothing else was
      DUE/ripe -- preflight all clean, no checks/audits due, 0 untriaged mail, no new nightly
      health data point to confirm): food 1, drug 1, device 1 -- all three unchanged since c2786,
      9 cycles with zero movement.** Still n=1 everywhere, tripwire NOT fired, no comment edit
      needed.

- [ ] **NEW tripwire candidate (c2540, LOW -- latent, not live today).** `parseMoney`
      (`grants-gov-scraper/src/main.js` 840-844) returns `null` for ANY non-string input, so if
      Grants.gov ever types `awardCeiling`/`awardFloor` as a real JSON number instead of the
      string it has always sent, every row in an amount-filtered run would fail the
      `typeof row.awardCeiling !== 'number'` test at 1222 and be dropped as `droppedNoAward` --
      a silent zero-row result that looks exactly like "no agency set a ceiling". Measured
      52/52 string at c2540, so there is nothing to fix now; the cheap guard if a future cycle
      touches this file is to accept `typeof v === 'number'` in `parseMoney` as well. Do NOT ship
      a build for this alone -- fold it into the next `grants-gov-scraper` build for another
      reason.

- [ ] **doc-trim cadence (orig. c2508, REWRITTEN c2520-c2588; execution records COMPRESSED
      c2652, re-compressed c2736 -- the c2604/c2605/c2628/c2634/c2643 narratives and the c2733
      STATUS.md execution record are verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2652 and c2736
      headers. KEEP THIS ITEM IN THIS SHAPE: method + standing rules + newest execution only.
      Do NOT prepend a full narrative per trim -- that habit grew this one item to 32% of the
      live queue.)**
      **EXECUTED c2784 (QUALITY slot).** Fresh `bin/check-doc-size` read 118.3KB/1353
      lines, TRIM SOON (proj. 246KB at next look, +5440 B/cycle, 24c out). Rule 4's
      arithmetic said a DONE-only cut could NOT work this time: 12 DONE blocks were only
      27KB of a 121KB file, leaving ~94KB against a 69KB safe line. So this cycle finally
      did what c2763 instructed ("retire or compress that OPEN tail rather than reaching
      for a third narrative trim -- do not let a third QUALITY slot pass without it") and
      took the biggest dead region in the file: **the c2756 item's own 277-line, self-
      labelled "HISTORICAL FROM HERE DOWN -- superseded by the c2780 block" tail.**
      c2775 had explicitly ruled that item OFF-LIMITS, but only because it was then
      mid-flight with a just-recorded next BUILD step; c2780 ran that screen, got
      NEGATIVE, and downgraded the item to CLOSED-FOR-BUILDS -- **the protection expired
      with its reason, which is why re-reading the predecessor's rationale (not just its
      verdict) is part of this method.** Rule 1's hazard grep over the archive-bound range
      paid for itself: it found two genuinely LIVE things buried in the dead tail -- the
      MCP #3 measurement gate (both dates, the read method, and what the numbers mean) and
      the missing-blog-guide gap for both MCP Actors -- which were rescued into the live
      item head instead of being archived. That cut alone gave 121.1KB/1354 lines ->
      71.1KB/794, but `check-doc-size` still projected 197KB against the 200KB line (a
      ~3KB margin), so **rule 4 was followed in the SAME cycle rather than banked**: a
      second pass (`bin/_trim2784q2.py`) compressed the dated-narrative half of the c2380
      one-term-diff item -- the target c2775 had scoped for this slot -- while
      **deliberately leaving its 8-step METHOD block live**, because LEARNINGS 2394-2428
      has the lessons behind steps 6/7/8 but not the operational recipe, so rule 1 makes
      this file its only home. **Combined result: 121.1KB/1354 lines -> 67.2KB/768 lines
      (-45%), `check-doc-size` OK, proj. 195KB at next look.** Genuinely-open items
      unchanged at 36 (the raw `- [ ] ` count went 37 -> 36 only because the c2777 block
      was DONE but mislabelled with an open box). Verified after each pass that every
      original line is present in either `queue_archive.md` or the live file (0 lines in
      neither).
      **HONEST CAVEAT for the next pass: ~195KB projected is still only a ~5KB margin.**
      The binding constraint is no longer dead text, it is the **+5440 B/cycle growth rate
      from the per-cycle DONE blocks themselves** -- a 24-cycle look-ahead costs 130KB no
      matter how clean the tail is. **So the next QUALITY slot should expect to trim again
      on the DONE blocks alone, and the real fix to propose is a shorter DONE-block house
      style, not a bigger cut.** Do NOT touch the c2478 item (live 2026-11-15 deadline) or
      c2532 (sole home of the `unreachable_remedy` per-Actor method, per c2775).
      `bin/_trim2784q.py` + `bin/_trim2784q2.py`; backups `/tmp/c2784_queue.bak`,
      `/tmp/c2784_queue2.bak`.
      **STANDING RULES -- these five were rescued from the archived narratives by the hazard
      grep; they are now ONLY here, so do not archive this section:**
      1. **Grep FIRST, then cut.** c2628 cut before grepping and was only saved by the
         archives keeping every line verbatim plus pre-cut backups. Do not rely on that twice.
      2. **Trim only in a QUALITY slot** (`cycle % 3 == 0`) -- `check-doc-size` says so in its
         own output ("trim proactively in a QUALITY slot rather than waiting for the
         escalation", c2220 follow-up) -- but **do not let a second QUALITY slot pass it**
         (c2604 deferred once; that was the limit).
      3. **Re-derive the partition shape fresh from the live file every time; never paste line
         numbers or block counts forward.** Each cycle's own prepended block shifts every line
         number in both docs. The scripts are hand-written one-shots, not parameterized --
         budget real time for this.
      4. **Do the margin arithmetic; a DONE-only cut is no longer reliably enough.** Compare
         the post-cut size against `200KB - (growth rate * cycles until the next look)`. If the
         margin is thin (<~15KB), compress or retire dead OPEN items in the same cycle rather
         than banking on the next DONE-only cut (c2556 precedent; c2652 did exactly this to
         this item).
      5. **Do NOT quote a target cycle number for the next trim.** Re-run `bin/check-doc-size`
         and trust its verdict.
      **Method:** copy `bin/_trim2588q.py` (queue.md, hoist-then-cut, newest one-shot and the one
      to clone) / `bin/_trim2574.py` (STATUS.md, stock keep-newest-5 block cut, same pattern as
      `bin/_trim2532.py`) / `bin/_trim2550.py` (LEARNINGS.md, oldest-contiguous-body
      move, never the highlights block). All are hand-written one-shots with explicit line
      ranges, NOT parameterized, so budget real time to re-derive the ranges from the live
      file's current headers before writing the next one. queue.md MUST use hoist-then-cut,
      because open `- [ ] ` items are interleaved among `- [x]` DONE blocks and a line cut
      would silently delete live work; assert the kept/hoisted/archived partition is total,
      non-overlapping and multiset-identical to the original before writing (and assert any new
      rewrite text separately, since it breaks that identity by design). STATUS.md carries no
      interleaved open items and is guarded by `bin/check-status-blocks-kept` at pre-commit plus
      `check-status-continuity`; both ran clean after this trim (0 blocks destroyed, NONE
      MISSING on the retained window).
      **Standing hazard, re-checked c2588, nothing found:** cadence instructions living only in
      queue.md prose have vanished into the archive before while the tool they describe still
      looked maintained (`bin/devto-comments`, `bin/check-competitor-claims`) -- so before
      archiving a block, read it in full and check whether it is the ONLY home of a cadence. All
      12 blocks archived at c2588 were checked this way (c2574 did the same for its 8): every
      "standing"/"cadence" phrase inside them is narrative *about* a cadence homed elsewhere --
      the checks-due/audit-due cadences live in those tools' own state, the dev.to syndication
      cadence in PLAYBOOK + `state/devto_syndicated.json`, and the one phrase that genuinely read
      like an instruction (the c2580 block's "**standing lesson:** never round-trip a state JSON
      through `json.dump` to change one string") was only archived after confirming it already
      has two homes in `notes/LEARNINGS.md` (lines 1729 and 5581). **Do the grep, then read the
      hits** -- the keyword alone over-matches, since nearly every DONE block says "per the
      standing rule" about a rule that lives in CLAUDE.md.

- [ ] **STANDING (orig. c2532, status layers REWRITTEN c2556, c2567; DOWNGRADED FROM HIGH c2607 --
      superseded c2532/c2537/c2548/c2552/c2556 narrative is in `queue_archive.md`).**
      **The original complaint -- that bare `bin/audit-due --all` silently defaulted to
      `competitor_audit` and never surfaced `unreachable_remedy` -- was fixed at c2601
      (`sweep_all_types()`), so the "run `--type unreachable_remedy` explicitly every cycle"
      workaround below is no longer necessary.** Re-verified live at c2607: bare `--all`'s FLEET
      ROTATIONS bucket and an explicit `--type unreachable_remedy` call agree (`NONE DUE`, soonest
      `court-records-scraper` in 264c / cycle 2871 by direct call -- matches `--all`'s own NONE DUE
      verdict for this axis). **Trust bare `--all` going forward; the explicit by-name call is only
      needed if you want this axis's own NEXT TARGET printed, not for correctness.**
      **Status verified live at c2567: 0 DUE, lap CLEAR.** All 23 tracked Actors are closed; the
      most recent close was `google-play-reviews-scraper` (CLOSED c2561, the last Actor on the
      prior lap -- `trademark-search-scraper` CLOSED c2558, `clinicaltrials-scraper` CLOSED c2560,
      `ats-jobs-scraper` CLOSED c2557, each a real defect, see the archived DONE blocks). The
      backlog goes quiet until the 336c cadence re-fires the oldest entries -- soonest is
      `hacker-news-scraper` at cycle 2870 (~6.3 days out). `count_audit` is CLOSED (0 DUE) too.
      **Do NOT trust a NEXT TARGET copied into this prose** -- it went stale twice before the
      c2556 rewrite and again by c2567; read the tool, every cycle.
      **Why this is its own item:** the warning above once existed only as one sentence buried
      inside the `enum_audit` item that c2532 archived -- i.e. the standing cadence-loss hazard
      that also produced the `devto-comments` / `check-competitor-claims` misses.
      **Shape of the work: one Actor per cycle; no batch screen exists.** `bin/enum-screen` does
      NOT support this type (zero hits for `unreachable_remedy`) and structurally cannot -- it
      diffs DECLARED schema enums, and remedy strings are prose. Per Actor: read every
      zero-row/error/truncated-result remedy string in `src/main.js`, extract the FACTUAL claims
      embedded in them ("field X is always null for tag Y", "the API caps at N hits", "a lower
      threshold is reachable"), and live-reverify each with cheap read-only curls -- usually $0,
      no Actor runs or charges needed.
      **Three probe refinements, each proven on a real close -- apply ALL THREE:** (i) read the
      PRIOR audit note first and aim at the claims it did NOT cover (c2536; and both real defects
      this backlog has yielded sat in material added AFTER the prior note, so this is where the
      yield actually is); (ii) fire the Actor's own upstream-fault negative control BEFORE
      believing any probe (c2536 -- Apple's per-IP empty-feed shell would have made every reading
      look like "upstream has nothing"); (iii) check `input_schema.json` reachability before
      trusting a deeper re-measurement (c2555 -- sweeping past the schema's own `maximum:` cap
      made a sound ~3% claim look 3-4x stale and nearly shipped a false "fix").
      **Expect confirmations, not defects.** Most closes come back CLEAN with no code change;
      the three real buyer-facing defects so far were `fda-recall-scraper` (c2552, an ~6x
      coverage overclaim live in the README FAQ), `federal-register-scraper` (c2554, a flat
      coverage figure that actually swings 42-68% by era), and `ats-jobs-scraper` (c2557, a
      salary-blind-ATS warning that overclaimed "no compensation" when Workday postings often
      carry real pay as free text under pay-transparency law). A clean close is a fine outcome --
      do NOT manufacture a code change to justify the slot (the c2524 rule), and do NOT bump an
      audit date without either a live re-verification or an explicit structural finding that
      there is nothing upstream to call.

- [ ] **NEW (c2478, MEDIUM, deadline 2026-11-15 -- CODE HALF SHIPPED c2496/c2500; what is
      left is a post-deadline re-read. Narrative compressed c2712 per the doc-trim item's
      rule 4; the full per-caller investigation is in `queue_archive.md` under the c2712
      header and in the c2496 DONE block.) -- Apify changes `GET /v2/store` on 2026-11-15:**
      (1) search returns one page of <=100 Actors, `offset`/`total` stop working, (2) `sortBy`
      is ignored, (3) category filtering can return different Actors, (4) `bookmarkCount`
      leaves the payload and ratings move into `stats`. Forwarded by owner, inbox `01852eaa`.
      **Shipped already, so a post-deadline run degrades honestly instead of lying:**
      `bin/store-anon-rank` and `bin/check-store-rank` detect dead paging structurally (they
      remember each page's first `(username, name)` and stop when one repeats) and report
      **`RANK UNKNOWN`, never `NOT FOUND`** -- without this they would have printed a
      confident false negative for every Actor ranked deeper than ~96, i.e. a fake
      fleet-wide ranking collapse inviting exactly the listing-copy churn c1468/c2280 warn
      against. `data.get("total")` everywhere; `check-store-rank` persists `paging_ok` per
      row; `bin/store-visibility`'s hard `d["total"]` KeyError fixed (c2478's own caller list
      had missed it). Confirmed SAFE and untouched: `niche-size`, `niche-unnamed`,
      `store-scan`, `apify-admin store`, `check-rental-converts`, `check-upstream-warnings`
      (all single-page); `store-rank`/`category-rank` are Algolia -- **Algolia is the real
      buyer surface and is unaffected.** Locked down by `bin/_store_paging_selftest.py`
      (3/3, no network/auth/cost), which fakes an offset-ignoring, `total`-less API.
      **STILL OPEN, do this AFTER 2026-11-15:** (a) run `bin/_store_paging_selftest.py`
      (expect 3/3) then a real `bin/store-anon-rank` -- the self-test says the degraded
      branch works, the live run says whether it is now the branch taken; (b) **the upside
      re-measure, which is the actually interesting half and is untouched:** Apify says the
      new default ranks by match-to-query, which could remove the cold-start `totalUsers`
      penalty that c2072 established (16 identically-named `grants-gov-scraper` listings, 87
      positions of spread with runs30d held equal). If a rank jumps into the top ~20
      *without* `totalUsers` rising, that falsifies the users-gating finding and is real news
      worth a strategy change -- but `/v2/store` is not the buyer surface, so read it as a
      hint about Apify's direction, not as recovered traffic. Pre-change baselines to compare
      against (both live-verified c2496): `store-anon-rank "court records"` **#29**, matching
      c2072 exactly, and `check-store-rank --scan 200 court-records-scraper` also **#29**
      plus `pacer court` #16. `paging_ok` True on every row is the expected reading until the
      date. **Standing rule (homed `notes/LEARNINGS.md:3582`): never leave a single-slug
      `check-store-rank` run in `state/store_rank.json` -- a 2-row snapshot in a 50-row
      series reads as "48 queries vanished" to the next diff; back the file up and restore.**

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2464, HIGH for correctness of every FUTURE sweep, but the bias is SAFE --
      do it on the next cycle that is about to run a `competitor_audit`, not as a standalone
      refactor) -- 15 of the 23 per-niche `_batch_price_*.py` copies still compare rival rungs
      against a single scalar `OURS` (our FREE price) instead of rung-for-rung.** Exact list,
      measured this cycle by `grep -l '^OURS = '`: `asr, ats3, crs, cts2, cts3, ggs2, hn2, nih,
      rjs, sgos2, substack (now superseded by substack2), ted, tms2, tms3, uktft2`. Measured
      impact in THIS niche: 94 flagged by the scalar read vs 43 rung-for-rung, a 2.2x
      over-flag. **Direction matters: this bias OVER-discloses rivals, which is the safe
      direction** (we name rivals who are not really beating us -- embarrassing but honest),
      unlike the AMBIGUOUS-drop below which UNDER-reports. So do NOT mass-rewrite 15 files in one
      cycle; instead, when a niche's `competitor_audit` next comes due, port that niche's pricer
      to the `_batch_price_substack2.py` shape (`cps.tier_price_at` rung-for-rung + keep the
      legacy flag alongside it purely to measure the delta, as substack2 does) as part of the
      sweep. `check-price-superiority` itself is already rung-correct (it reports "2210 tiered
      ladders checked at every rung"), so the FLEET GUARD is sound -- this is only about the
      per-niche sweep scripts that decide who gets a README write-up.
      **c2740 made this port CHEAPER -- do not re-derive the comparison by hand.** `bin/_unit_price.py`
      now exports `expand_flat()` / `undercut_tiers(ut, OURS)` / `beats_every_tier(ut, OURS)`, which are
      rung-for-rung AND flat-rival-correct, so porting a niche is: give that file a tiered `OURS` dict,
      call the two helpers, keep the old expression as `legacy_*` for the delta. `ats3`/`rjs`/`uktft2`
      are already done this way -- copy one of them. NOTE the two bugs are independent: c2740 fixed the
      RIVAL-side flat under-check, this item is still open for the 15 files whose OUR-side `OURS` is a
      scalar, and those are mostly a DIFFERENT set (overlap is `asr`, `ggs2`, `hn2`, `sgos2`, `substack`,
      `ted` -- all Family-B scalar files, none of which c2740 touched).

- [ ] **NEW note (c2464, TRIVIAL but saves a wasted probe next time) -- the live Store README is
      on the BUILD record, not the Actor record.** `GET /v2/acts/<id>` returned `readme: ""`
      (0 bytes) for `fetchsmith~substack-scraper` immediately after a successful push this cycle,
      which looks exactly like a failed README upload; `GET /v2/acts/<id>/builds/<buildId>`
      carries the real 68,158-byte README and confirmed byte-identical. Use the build endpoint
      for the standard post-push byte-identical check.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2456, LOW, gated -- only if a buyer ever asks) -- settle
      `codepal/app-review-intelligence`'s billed unit by RUNNING it once.** It is the single lowest
      per-row figure found in this niche across seven sweeps ($0.00001, a genuine primary event,
      not a decoy), and it is the one listing whose undercut we can neither confirm nor deny: its
      description sells insight records (complaint topics, feature requests, rating trends), so one
      billed row may cover many reviews, or may be one review. c2456 deliberately published no
      number. A single cheap run against one small app would settle it -- if a row is one review it
      belongs in the running total as the niche's cheapest listing by 10x, which is a materially
      different sentence from the one the README now carries. NOT worth a paid run on its own; do it
      opportunistically if another cycle is already running competitor smoke tests in this niche.

- [ ] **NEW (c2396, LOW priority, build only if a buyer asks) -- single-notice-by-id mode needs
      its own normalizer and a 401 trap.** There is NO search-by-id path: `q=<32-hex id>` -> 0
      (the id is not in the full-text index) and `id`/`noticeId`/`_id` all fail OPEN (each
      returned the full 5,649,458). The only route is `GET /api/prod/opps/v2/opportunities/<id>`,
      which does return the record in ONE request with no search call -- but in a different shape:
      fields live under `data2` (`data2.solicitationNumber`, `data2.title`, `data2.award`, ...)
      while search rows are flat, so `normalizeRow` cannot be reused as-is. **Trap, worth more
      than the feature:** an unknown id returns **HTTP 401 `UNAUTHORIZED`, not 404**. Generic
      error handling will read that as a dead/blocked upstream or an auth failure and may trip the
      upstream-health machinery when it only means "no such notice". Map 401-on-detail to a clean
      not-found BEFORE building this.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2392, LOW priority, gated) -- `postedFrom`/`postedTo` as a post-fetch
      filter cannot make a run CHEAPER upstream, and on a broad keyword it can burn the time
      budget before `maxResults` is filled.** Measured this cycle: a `deadlineTo`-windowed watch
      baseline walked 8 pages of a 720-match query and still came up short. This is disclosed
      honestly in the README bullet and FAQ, so it is not a false claim -- but if a buyer ever
      reports it (or a `varied_test` audit trips on it), the fix is a `sortBy=-publishDate`-style
      server-side ordering probe: IF SAM.gov's `opp` index honours a date sort param, a
      `postedFrom`-only window could stop paging as soon as rows fall below the floor instead of
      walking the whole match set. Probe before building: this backend silently ignores unknown
      sort params (same trap as `state` vs `pop_state`), so confirm the ORDER actually changes on
      a 2-page read before relying on it. Do NOT start this speculatively -- it is an optimisation
      with no reported buyer pain, and the honest disclosure already covers the gap.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2388, LOW -- do NOT act before the trigger fires) -- apply the
      snapshot-age lesson to the fleet's OTHER snapshot-reading checkers, but only once a
      second real instance turns up** (per the c2383 standing method: build the general fix
      on the second instance, not the first). c2388's fix was local to `bin/check-row-floor`
      because that is the only checker so far OBSERVED to mislead a cycle this way. The
      general rule is in `notes/PLAYBOOK.md`: *any checker that reads a periodically-written
      state file is reporting the past -- make it print the snapshot's age, and give it a
      way to re-verify the present.* **Candidates to audit when the trigger fires** (each
      reads a file some other job writes, so each can report a healed problem as current):
      `bin/check-field-fill` and anything else reading `state/health.json`, plus checkers
      reading `state/revenue.json` / `state/store_rank.json` / `state/audit_dates.json`.
      Cheap method: `grep -ln "state/.*\.json" bin/check-*` then, for each hit, ask whether
      the file is written by THAT checker (fine) or by a separate scheduled job (suspect).
      **Trigger:** a cycle wastes real time diagnosing a flag from one of those that turns
      out to be already-healed. Until then this is speculative tidying, not value.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2385, low priority) -- when `check-competitor-claims` next flags a sub-20
      rival count STALE on `grants-gov-scraper` or `sam-gov-opportunities-scraper` (the two READMEs
      confirmed at c2385 to still be publishing fresh sub-20 counts in every new competitor_audit
      paragraph), strip it on sight rather than hand-fixing the single number** -- same rationale as
      the original `0-TODO-h1346` backlog (a sub-20 count is permanent noise at 10% tolerance). Not
      worth a preventive checker yet since the cost (0 currently stale) hasn't materialized; revisit
      if a THIRD Actor shows the same live-stale pattern.

- [ ] **STANDING METHOD (c2383) -- if a future cycle ships a platform/board/source-count expansion
      on a multi-source Actor (the next most likely candidates: `remote-jobs-scraper`'s 7 boards,
      `nih-reporter-scraper`'s claimed sources, `uk-find-a-tender-scraper`'s 2 portals), re-run
      this cycle's two greps against that Actor's own README afterward to catch the
      `ats-jobs-scraper`-shaped staleness before it sits for 9+ days:**
      `grep -n "of our [0-9]\+ (platform\|source\|field\|board\|portal)" actors/<slug>/README.md`
      and `grep -n "our \(seven\|ten\|[0-9]\+\) \(platforms\|sources\|boards\|portals\)" actors/<slug>/README.md`.
      Do not build a dedicated fleet checker for this unless a second real instance turns up.

- [ ] **FOLLOW-UP from c2380 -- the one-term-diff pass. STILL OPEN as a recurring
      per-niche re-check, but NOTHING IS DUE and it is NOT a valid fallback pick today.
      (Narrative compressed c2784; pre-compression text verbatim in `queue_archive.md`
      under the c2784 header. Per-niche execution detail: `notes/LEARNINGS.md` cycles
      2384/2730/2735/2737/2738 and `queue_archive.md` c2685/c2736/c2766.)**
      **Applied to 8 niches, all three originally-scoped ones EXHAUSTED:**
      `uk-find-a-tender` (c2380, re-swept c2779), `trademark-search` (c2384),
      `federal-register` (c2389), `fec-campaign-finance` (c2727), `us-federal-awards`
      (c2730), `clinicaltrials` (c2735), `ats-jobs` (c2737), `remote-jobs` (c2738).
      Next time this surfaces: either widen to a NEW niche, or treat it as a per-niche
      re-check on a ~8-10 day (384-480c) cadence.
      **HOW TO DERIVE "STALEST" (corrected c2780 -- c2779 got this wrong and swept a
      niche that had been fully audited 6 days earlier):** a niche's last-swept date is
      `max(last one-term pass, audit_dates.json competitor_audit)`, because a full
      multi-term `competitor_audit` strictly supersedes a one-term diff over the same
      niche. **Do not hand-compute it -- `bin/audit-due competitor_audit` already prints
      `last`/`gap`/the backed-off interval per Actor; read the row.** Related, so no cycle
      re-opens it as a bug: `audit-due` printing NONE DUE on a 1341-cycle gap is CORRECT --
      two clean streaks widen the interval to the 1344c cap (`BASE * 2**min(streak,2)`).
      **Gate: do not pick this rotation as a fallback until `audit-due competitor_audit`
      shows a real 384c+ gap on some niche.** (Measured c2780: nothing was 8-10 days
      stale; fec was the one outlier and came due on its own beat at c2783.)
      **The companion "rising matched-count in a README" grep is on a backoff and is
      EMPTY: five consecutive 0-candidate reads (c2654, c2662, c2681, c2701, c2739).**
      Use the TIGHT pattern -- require `listings`/`matched` directly ADJACENT to the arrow,
      not merely nearby (the loose c2701 form returned 41KB of "N users"/"N platforms"
      noise vs 4 lines tight). Wait ~50-60 cycles after c2739 before the next retry, and
      re-grep fresh (any README could grow the shape); never trust a cached list.
      The c2380 lesson is fleet-general: any Actor whose README records
      a RISING matched-listing count between audits is stale between the 672-cycle
      `competitor_audit` beats. Method, ~15 min per Actor, cheap:
      (1) `grep -onE "202[67]-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}" README.md` for future-dated prose (c2376);
      (2) ONE `apify-admin store "<best single term>" 100` sweep; (3) `grep -qF "$handle"`
      diff against the README; (4) live-price the unnamed tail with the Actor's own
      `bin/_batch_price_<abbr>.py` (it reads a handle list from a /tmp file -- see the
      `handles = [...open("/tmp/..._unnamed3.txt")]` line); (5) for every undercutter, fetch
      `createdAt` + `pricingInfos[].startedAt` and compare to the last audit date, to say
      honestly whether it is a MISS or a NEW entrant; (6) **resolve any `AMBIGUOUS: N
      recurring, no primary flag` by reading the events** -- two same-priced recurring events
      is just a flat per-row rate, and dropping it loses a real undercutter (that is exactly
      how `data-done-right` would have been missed). **(7) NEW at c2384 -- also grep the pricer
      dump for the `FREE model / no pricing record -- $0` shape, not just for prices below ours.**
      A `pricingModel: FREE` rival with an empty `pricingInfos` prints as
      `None {'FREE': 0.0} ['FREE']`, which reads to the eye like an unresolved/missing-data row
      but is actually the most aggressive price in the niche (that is how
      `rbbscrap/fast-uspto-trademark-scraper` nearly got skipped). Same lesson as step 6 arriving
      in a different empty-looking costume: read the listing, never drop it.
      **(8) NEW at c2384 -- re-read the Actor's own pricing-decision paragraph and check whether
      its stated REVISIT TRIGGER has already fired**, since a trigger is a claim and nothing
      watches it (see the dedicated c2384 follow-up above). Do NOT run a full multi-term audit --
      that is the `audit-due` beat and stays on its cadence.

- [ ] **NEW STANDING TRIPWIRE (c2336, COMPRESSED c2775 -- pre-compression per-event narrative
      verbatim in `queue_archive.md` under the c2775 header) -- re-diff `ext_bad30d` out of
      `state/revenue_history.json` at the start of every cycle. ~2 seconds, $0, read-only. This is
      the ONLY signal we have that reflects a real buyer's run FAILING.**
      One-liner that produced the c2336 finding:
      `venv/bin/python -c "import json;h=json.load(open('state/revenue_history.json'));p={}
      [print(s['date'],n,{k:v for k,v in (a.get('ext_stats30d') or {}).items() if k in ('FAILED','ABORTED','TIMED-OUT') and v}) for s in h for n,a in s['apify'].items() if (lambda b: b and p.get(n)!=b and (p.update({n:b}) or True))({k:v for k,v in (a.get('ext_stats30d') or {}).items() if k in ('FAILED','ABORTED','TIMED-OUT') and v})]"`
      (or just re-walk the history in a small script -- the shape is `snapshot['apify'][slug]['ext_stats30d']`).
      **Current confirmed state (re-diffed c2662, 2026-11-03): 4 lifetime events, all resolved/aged
      out -- 3 long-known one-offs (`court-records-scraper`/`google-news-scraper` TIMED-OUT,
      `scholarship-scraper` FAILED; causes already fixed or the Actor retired; `remote-jobs-
      scraper`'s earlier TIMED-OUT entry has itself since aged out of the 30d window) plus
      `nih-reporter-scraper` FAILED 1 (2026-11-03, a guard correctly rejecting an input but in a
      format that was actually NIH's own "FY2024" convention -- fixed, LEARNINGS Cycle 2647).**
      **Any entry beyond those four is NEW and names the Actor to look at first.**
      Triage order that worked: (1) is the Actor's `actor-health` green on its default input? if yes
      it is not an outage; (2) is it the TIMED-OUT class? **do not assume this axis is closed just
      because a `timeoutAt`/budget guard exists** -- c2471 found a sound-looking guard on
      `remote-jobs-scraper`, called it a one-off, and left it "not fully proven"; the TIMED-OUT
      recurred and Cycle 2646 found the real defect: `timeout:{request:ms}` bounds one HTTP
      attempt, not one call, so `got`'s own internal retries multiply it ~4x and a between-boards
      budget check can't help. Fixed fleet-wide with `AbortSignal.timeout()` clamped to
      `remainingMs()` (~19 Actors + `_template`, campaign closed c2646/commit `0a7e7800`) --
      LEARNINGS Cycle 2646 has the full method if this class resurfaces; (3) otherwise read every
      path that can end the run (`Actor.fail`, `throw`, and the zero-row/partial status branches)
      and look for an input shape that is dropped without ever reaching a status message.
      **Do NOT email the owner about an `ext_bad30d` entry** -- a failed run is not revenue and not
      owner-fixable.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2312) -- `scholarship-scraper` carries an UNPUSHED code fix.** c2312 found
      and fixed the same unvalidated-date-bound bug there (`Date.parse(...)` -> `NaN`, and
      `NaN != null` is true, so the guard passes and the filter both widens and hides undated
      rows). It was deliberately NOT pushed: that Actor is the fleet's only `status: retired`
      registry entry and is PAUSED on the Store, so a ~$0.005 build buys nothing today.
      **Action required only if/when it is ever un-retired: `apify push --force` it** so the live
      build actually contains the fix. Do not spend a build on it before then.
      **c2372 -- this item now has a real TRIGGER instead of depending on somebody remembering it.**
      Re-probed bold.org live (2026-10-28): still `429` Vercel Security Checkpoint on
      `/scholarships/`, `/sitemap.xml` AND `/scholarships/by-major/`, so the deferral still holds and
      the date-bound bug is still unreachable (0 rows to filter). But the Actor is **PAUSED, not
      unlisted** -- `isPublic: true`, 23 external SUCCEEDED runs in the 30d window, last 2026-10-27 --
      and `bold.org` was absent from `state/upstream_hosts.json` entirely (`scholarship-scraper: []`,
      excluded at c2150 for "status=retired"), so NOTHING in the fleet would ever have noticed the
      block lifting. Added `bold.org` to the host list plus a new opt-in `watch_recovery` block, and
      taught `bin/check-source-endpoints` to flag `client-error/server-error/error -> ok/redirect` as
      `RECOVERED` for watched hosts only (its `broke` rule fires only on ok -> error, i.e. it was
      structurally blind to recovery). Baseline now on file at `client-error/429`.
      **So: when `check-source-endpoints` next prints `RECOVERED bold.org`, that is the signal to
      un-pause the listing and push the held fix. Do not go re-probe bold.org by hand on spec.**
      Honest limit: the checker runs on a 336c (~7d) cadence, so detection can lag the real lift by
      up to a week -- vastly better than never, but do not treat it as real-time.

- [ ] **Process lesson to apply on any cycle that changes BOTH Actor code and listing copy
      (learned the expensive way, c2288): run `bin/apify-admin publish <slug> meta.json` FIRST,
      then ONE `apify push --force -w 600`.** Doing it in the other order (push, then publish)
      makes `publish` print `REINDEX REQUIRED` and demand a second billable build, because the
      Store search index only refreshes when a build finishes. c2288 paid ~$0.005 twice for this.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2196) -- consider an ack STALENESS warning in `check-upstream-warnings`.**
      Acks currently never expire. An ack written against a correct verification stays silent
      even if, 500 cycles later, we refactor the Actor back onto the dead upstream (unlikely) or
      the rival's warning becomes relevant to a DIFFERENT Actor of ours sharing that upstream.
      Cheap, bounded fix: print `ACK STALE (acked cNNNN, >672c ago -- re-verify)` next to any
      acked hit older than the longest audit interval, without changing the exit code. Only
      worth doing once there are >2 acks or the oldest crosses ~672 cycles (i.e. ~cycle 2868);
      noted now so the decision is deliberate rather than forgotten.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2168, REWRITTEN c2268 -- the old wording named a leader on a metric
      that retracts) -- watch for the first real buyer. Do NOT watch the `users` column.**
      Decision rule, so a future cycle doesn't have to re-derive it: external runs are
      observable but earnings are NOT, so the escalation trigger is a **bookmark, a review, or
      `bin/traffic` buyer intent** (the CLAUDE.md Polar gate: >100 verified visits/day to
      /pricing or /tools), NOT a run-count or user-count climb. A climb alone must never
      trigger an owner email -- c2168 confirmed we cannot see earnings, so we could not
      substantiate a revenue claim even if we wanted to.
      **Why `users` was retired as a signal (full write-up: LEARNINGS c2268):** the old wording
      named a single Actor as "the only one at N users" off a snapshot that proved false almost
      immediately -- `state/revenue_history.json` shows per-Actor `users` oscillating within
      hours (e.g. 1->2->3->1 in ~36h), not cumulative and not monotone, so a +1 is no evidence a
      real user arrived. `bkmk`/`rev` do not oscillate the same way, which is why they (plus
      `bin/traffic` buyer intent) are the usable signals instead.

- [ ] **NEW follow-up (c2371) -- accumulate DMARC sample before considering `p=reject`.**
      First post-fix report (`af5d9f7d`, 2026-10-27 range) was 1 source / 0 fails / 100%
      pass. **Sample 2 of ~4-5 read c2372: `202905fb` (ts 1793184032, range 1793059200-
      1793145599 = 2026-10-26), also 1 source / 0 fails -- `54.240.11.115`, `disposition=none`,
      `dkim=pass` on BOTH `fetchsmith.com` (selector `resend`) and `amazonses.com`, `spf=pass`
      on `send.fetchsmith.com`. Same single Resend/SES egress path as sample 1, so these two
      samples are not independent evidence about OTHER senders -- they only confirm our one
      real path aligns. Policy still `p=quarantine`.** Not enough to decide anything yet. On a future cycle that finds 3-4 more weekly
      reports on file (`bin/dmarc-report list`, all with real attachments, i.e. ts after
      1792822587 / 2026-10-24T06:16:27Z): if every source across all of them passes DKIM+SPF
      alignment, that is a reasonable basis to flip `_dmarc.fetchsmith.com` `p=quarantine` ->
      `p=reject` via the Cloudflare API (token + zone/record IDs already in STATUS.md history,
      cycle 1625). If any source fails, read which sending path it is before touching policy --
      it may be a legitimate forwarder needing an SPF/DKIM fix, not a real spoofer.

- [ ] **Process lesson to apply every cycle (found c2120).** Do NOT trust the previous cycle's
      "nothing audit-due" prediction -- c2119 wrote "NONE DUE fleet-wide" and one cycle later the
      7-day floor had made `google-play-reviews-scraper` due. Always re-run `bin/audit-due --all`
      and `bin/checks-due` yourself at the top of the cycle. (Cheap, read-only, local.)
